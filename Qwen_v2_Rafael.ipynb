      "1  Summarize in around 100 words, focusing on CO2 emissions and numerical data: In the present article, we aim to quantify the carbon footprint of BLOOM, a 176-billion parameter language model, across its life cycle We estimate that BLOOM’s ﬁnal training emitted approximately 24.7 tonnes of CO2eq if we consider only the dynamic power consumption, and 50.5 tonnes if we account for all processes ranging from equipment manufacturing to energy-based operational consumption We conclude with a discussion regarding the difﬁculty of precisely estimating the carbon footprint of ML models and future research directions that can contribute towards improving carbon emissions reporting. 1 Introduction Climate change is one of our generation’s biggest challenges, impacting ecosystems and livelihoods across the world; estimating and reducing our carbon emissions is an important part of mitigating its impacts [23] According to recent estimates, the global CO2 emissions of the information and communications technology (ICT) sector account for around 2% of global CO2 emissions, but this ﬁgure is hard to estimate precisely given the distributed nature of global computing infrastructure [14, 22, 7] We conclude with a discussion about the carbon emissions of different LLMs as well as the BigScience workshop overall, and propose directions for future work to both quantify and report these emissions. 2 Related Work There are different aspects of the environmental impact of computing in general and machine learning in particular that are relevant to our study; we brieﬂy describe existing relevant work in the paragraphs below. Empirical Studies on ML CO2 Emissions Most of the existing work in this area has been done on estimating the CO2 emissions incurred during model training Starting with the seminal work of Strubell et al., who looked at the arXiv:2211.02001v1 [cs.LG] 3 Nov 2022 Question: What is the estimated carbon emission linked to training AI models? Provide a concise answer with numerical data only According to the referenced work, training a large AI model can emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide. For instance, one study estimates that the training of a model similar to GPT-3 could result in emissions between 460-13,343 kg CO₂eq, depending on the energy mix used. Another model's training was estimated to emit about 87,552 kWh of electricity, which translates to roughly 66.2 tonnes CO²eq assuming an  \n",
