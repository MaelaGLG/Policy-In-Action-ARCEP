disruption, yet we rarely witness a technology emerge with propensity to shock like artificial intelligence (AI).\\n\\nThis year started with a bang when Chinese startup DeepSeek launched R1, an open-source, low-cost large language model (LLM) that blindsided global tech, knocked nearly $600 billion off U.S. chipmaker Nvidia’s market value, and provoked a serious spat with OpenAI over proprietary technology. No one (or few, at least) saw that coming.\\n\\nFuture shockwaves look inevitable. Yet, despite its unpredictability, AI is ripe for speculation: What’s next for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and intelligent agents? How will lawsuits and regulation play out? Will solutions emerge for AI’s sticky sustainability problem?\\n\\nAs the DeepSeek dust settles, AI experts from different fields were asked what breakthroughs and challenges they expect to see in the rest of 2025.\\n\\nTracking the technological trends\\n\\nLLMs continue to be at the front of researchers’ minds, but there are many other advances to watch.\\n\\nSonja Schmer-Galunder, Glenn and Deborah Renwick Leadership Professor in AI and Ethics at the University of Florida, predicted an increase in the “democratization” of AI development. “We will see more open source and proliferation of competitive models, especially now, after DeepSeek. This could help balance the current concentration of AI power,” she said.\\n\\nAccording to Schmer-Galunder, there is also “lots of talk” about AI agents, despite the lack of established ethical guidelines and standards for their safe use. “Agents will likely mature further and become more task-specific. The problem is often that real-world implementations show limitations or unintended uses,” she said.\\n\\nIsabelle Augenstein, an expert in natural language processing (NLP) at Denmark’s University of Copenhagen and a co-lead of Denmark’s Pioneer Centre for Artificial Intelligence, expects to see new LLMs focused on non-English languages. “Moreover, I hope to see increased multi-modal capabilities of LLMs, an area where they are still lacking,” she said.\\n\\nAugenstein also flagged breakthroughs in the development of small, high-performance models that are less compute- and cost-hungry. “This would be important both from an environmental perspective and for adoption in more scenarios,” she said.\\n\\nKeiland Cooper, a cognitive scientist and neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, and president of non-profit research organization ContinualAI, anticipates advances in AI for scientific research. In the drug development space, Cooper highlighted a recent analysis by researchers at the Boston Consulting Group of the performance of AI-discovered drugs in clinical trials. The researchers found that “AI-discovered molecules have an 80-90% success rate, substantially higher than historic industry averages.”\\n\\nAdvances in robotics should be expected too, said Cooper. “The barriers of mapping the physical to the digital space—while not completely overcome— have been aided by clever methods learned from training LLMs, and applying and mixing them with new data types to the robotics space.”\\n\\nJuan David Gutiérrez is an associate professor at the Universidad del Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia. Like Augenstein, Gutiérrez expects to see growth in non-English-language LLMs and pointed to the development of Latam-GPT, a 50B-parameter LLM based on a Spanish-Latin American corpus.\\n\\nAcross Latin America, predicted Gutiérrez, governments will continue to expand their use of AI. His current research has identified over 500 AI systems already used by governments in the region. “The expansion is not just quantitative, but also in terms of the diversity of sectors of government where AI is deployed,” he said.\\n\\nHowever, Gutiérrez anticipates AI advances could be impacted by U.S. restrictions on exporting hardware and wider data access. “Difficulties in accessing data of the required quality and volume will be a significant barrier for companies that are trying to develop new models that are customized for the needs of the region.”\\n\\nAI challenges are becoming ever more complex and global\\n\\nThe unfolding story of AI is more complicated than the sum of its technological breakthroughs. Who gets to build AI, how fast it is rolled out, and how it is legislated (or not) are critical topics up for debate in 2025.\\n\\nSaid Schmer-Galunder, “Big tech companies seem to be completely engulfed in an accelerating race towards AGI (artificial general intelligence), under the assumption that whoever gets there first, wins. This has global geopolitical ramifications affecting national security and economic power.” She pointed to international cooperation and the adoption of frameworks for developing safe AI as potential solutions.\\n\\nAugenstein identified a growing “disconnect” between academia and industry in the research space, as well as between big tech and other stakeholders. “This is both due to the closed-source nature of many high-performance language models, as well as the computational costs of training and experimenting with LLMs on an academic compute budget,” she said.\\n\\nGutiérrez expects to see AI regulation adopted more widely across Latin American in 2025, at both the national and subnational levels. “In countries such as Chile, Brazil, and Colombia, the bills have advanced and may be approved by the end of the year,” he said. However, there are concerns: while issuing legislation may be reasonably straightforward, “Building implementation capacity is difficult for Latin American countries, given the financial constraints that most states face,” he said.\\n\\nThe ongoing debate over societal impact and sustainability\\n\\nResponsible AI that is sustainable and built for the public good is an often-cited aspiration in academia and industry, yet consensus on responsible solutions remains elusive.\\n\\nSaid Cooper, “While sustainability has been in the back of many researchers’ minds for some time, further techniques to drive down the cost and energy use of training models is a growing concern as models continue to grow larger.”\\n\\nGenAI’s popularity is exacerbating the sustainability issue, said Schmer-Galunder. “We are building giant datacenters that use lots of unnecessary energy for silly prompt requests, sometimes just for our entertainment.”\\n\\nAt a societal level, Schmer-Galunder raised concerns about the absence of collective decision-making as AI continues to fundamentally reshape our lives. “This change is happening even though we lack a coherent vision for the type of society we want, or want to create, for generations to come,” she said.\\n\\nSchmer-Galunder suggested that while technology can boost efficiency, we may not want it to penetrate every aspect of our lives. “We need to really deeply think about that and, collectively, decide where we don’t want AI—either because we want humans to stay in control, or because it doesn’t lead to improvements in well-being.”\\n\\nThe thrilling potential of technological breakthroughs mixed with challenges around competition, legislation, geopolitics, and sustainability loom large in the AI outlook. The likelihood of shockwaves also seems high. In Cooper’s words, “As always, I’m most excited about the advances that we didn’t see coming.”\\n\\nThat AI shocks will happen in 2025 is perhaps predictable now, but what those shocks look like and what their consequences will be are the big unknowns.\\n\\nKaren Emslie is a location-independent freelance journalist and essayist.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            When Adam Rodman was a second-year medical student in the 2000s, he visited the library for a patient whose illness had left doctors stumped. Rodman searched the catalog, copied research papers, and shared them with the team.\\n\\n“It made a big difference in that patient’s care,” Rodman said. “Everyone said, ‘This is so great. This is evidence-based medicine.’ But it took two hours. I can do that today in 15 seconds.”\\n\\nRodman, now an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and a doctor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, these days carries a medical library in his pocket — a smartphone app created after the release of the large language model ChatGPT in 2022. OpenEvidence — developed in part by Medical School faculty — allows him to query specific diseases and symptoms. It searches the medical literature, drafts a summary of findings, and lists the most important sources for further reading, providing answers while Rodman is still face-to-face with his patient.\\n\\n“We say, ‘Wow, the technology is really powerful.’ But what do we do with it to actually change things?” Adam Rodman\\n\\nArtificial intelligence in various forms has been used in medicine for decades — but not like this. Experts predict that the adoption of large language models will reshape medicine. Some compare the potential impact with the decoding of the human genome, even the rise of the internet. The impact is expected to show up in doctor-patient interactions, physicians’ paperwork load, hospital and physician practice administration, medical research, and medical education.\\n\\nMost of these effects are likely to be positive, increasing efficiency, reducing mistakes, easing the nationwide crunch in primary care, bringing data to bear more fully on decision-making, reducing administrative burdens, and creating space for longer, deeper person-to-person interactions.\\n\\nAdam Rodman, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center “The optimist in me hopes that AI can make us doctors better versions of ourselves to better care for our patients.” transcript Close transcript Transcript: ADAM RODMAN: I am obsessed with metacognition, with thinking about thinking. So what excites me most about AI and medicine? Well, the optimist in me hopes that AI and medicine can make us doctors better versions of ourselves to better care for our patients. I think the best case scenario for me is a world in which an artificial intelligence is communicating with me and my patients, looking for signs of implicit bias, looking for signs that I might be making the wrong decision, and more importantly, feeding back that information to me so that I can improve over time, so that I can become a better human. My worry is actually directly related to this. These are very powerful reasoning technologies, and really what is medical education other than a way to frame and shape the medical mind? So part of my worry is that because these technologies are so powerful, they’ll shortcut many of the ways that we know that doctors learn and get better, and we may end up with generations of physicians who don’t know how to think the best. I don’t think that this is the foregone conclusion, but it really is my worry about the way that things are going.\\n\\nBut there are serious concerns, too.\\n\\nCurrent data sets too often reflect societal biases that reinforce gaps in access and quality of care for disadvantaged groups. Without correction, these data have the potential to cement existing biases into ever-more-powerful AI that will increasingly influence how healthcare operates.\\n\\nAnother important issue, experts say, is that AIs remain prone to “hallucination,” making up “facts” and presenting them as if they are real.\\n\\nThen there’s the danger that medicine won’t be bold enough. The latest AI has the potential to remake healthcare top to bottom, but only if given a chance. The wrong priorities — too much deference to entrenched interests, a focus on money instead of health — could easily reduce the AI “revolution” to an underwhelming exercise in tinkering around the edges.\\n\\n“I think we’re in this weird space,” Rodman said. “We say, ‘Wow, the technology is really powerful.’ But what do we do with it to actually change things? My worry, as both a clinician and a researcher, is that if we don’t think big, if we don’t try to rethink how we’ve organized medicine, things might not change that much.”\\n\\nShoring up the ‘tottering edifice’\\n\\nFive years ago, when asked about AI in healthcare, Isaac Kohane responded with frustration. Teenagers tapping away on social media apps were better equipped than many doctors. The situation today couldn’t be more different, he says.\\n\\nKohane, chair of the Medical School’s Department of Biomedical Informatics and editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine’s new AI initiative, describes the abilities of the latest models as “mind boggling.” To illustrate the point, he recalled getting an early look at OpenAI’s GPT-4. He tested it with a complex case — a child born with ambiguous genitalia — that might have stymied even an experienced endocrinologist. Kohane asked GPT-4 about genetic causes, biochemical pathways, next steps in the workup, even what to tell the child’s parents. It aced the test.\\n\\n“This large language model was not trained to be a doctor; it’s just trained to predict the next word,” Kohane said. “It could speak as coherently about wine pairings with a vegetarian menu as diagnose a complex patient. It was truly a quantum leap from anything that anybody in computer science who was honest with themselves would have predicted in the next 10 years.”\\n\\nIsaac Kohane, chairman of Harvard Medical School’s Department of Biomedical Informatics and editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine’s new AI journal “Having an instant second opinion after any interaction with a clinician will change, for the better, the nature of the doctor-patient relationship.” transcript Close transcript Transcript: ISAAC KOHANE: I am most excited that AI is going to transform the patient experience. Just merely having an instant second opinion after any interaction with a clinician will change to the better the nature of the doctor-patient relationship. Also, with regard to what things I fear could go wrong, it’s that parties that do not have the patient’s best interest will be the ones steering the tendencies/biases or prejudices of our new AI companions.\\n\\nAnd none too soon. The U.S. healthcare system, long criticized as costly, inefficient, and inordinately focused on treatment over prevention, has been showing cracks. Kohane, recalling a faculty member new to the department who couldn’t find a primary care physician, is tired of seeing them up close.\\n\\n“The medical system, which I have long said is broken, is broken in extremely obvious ways in Boston,” he said. “People worry about equity problems with AI. I’m here to say we have a huge equity problem today. Unless you’re well connected and are willing to pay literally thousands of extra dollars for concierge care, you’re going to have trouble finding a timely primary care visit.”\\n\\nEarly worries that AI would replace physicians have yielded to the realization that the system needs both AI and its human workforce, Kohane said. Teaming nurse practitioners and physician assistants with AI is one among several promising scenarios.\\n\\n“It is no longer a conversation about, ‘Will AI replace doctors,’ so much as, ‘Will AI, with a set of clinicians who may not look like the clinicians that we’re used to, firm up the tottering edifice that is organized medicine?’”\\n\\nBuilding the optimal assistant\\n\\nHow LLMs were rolled out — to everyone at once — accelerated their adoption, Kohane says. Doctors immediately experimented with eye-glazing yet essential tasks, like writing prior authorization requests to insurers explaining the necessity of specific, usually expensive, treatments.\\n\\n“People just did it,” Kohane said. “Doctors were tweeting back and forth about all the time they were saving.”\\n\\nPatients did it too, seeking virtual second opinions, like the child whose recurring pain was misdiagnosed by 17 doctors over three years. In the widely publicized case, the boy’s mother entered his medical notes into ChatGPT, which suggested a condition no doctor had mentioned: tethered cord syndrome, in which the spinal cord binds inside of the backbone. When the patient moves, rather than sliding smoothly, the spinal cord stretches, causing pain. The diagnosis was confirmed by a neurosurgeon, who then corrected the anatomic anomaly.\\n\\nOne of the perceived benefits of employing AI in the clinic, of course, is to make doctors better the first time around. Greater, faster access to case histories, suggested diagnoses, and other data is expected to improve physician performance. But plenty of work remains, a recent study shows.\\n\\nResearch published in JAMA Network Open in October compared diagnoses delivered by an individual doctor, a doctor using an LLM diagnostic tool, and an LLM alone. The results were surprising, showing an insignificant improvement in accuracy for the physicians using the LLM — 76 percent versus 74 percent for the solitary physician. More surprisingly, the LLM by itself did best, scoring 16 percentage points higher than physicians alone.\\n\\nRodman, one of the paper’s senior authors, said it’s tempting to conclude that LLMs aren’t that helpful for doctors, but he insisted that it’s important to look deeper at the findings. Only 10 percent of the physicians, he said, were experienced LLM users before the study — which took place in 2023— and the rest received only basic training. Consequently, when Rodman later looked at the transcripts, most used the LLMs for basic fact retrieval.\\n\\n“The best way a doctor could use it now is for a second opinion, to second-guess themselves when they have a tricky case,” he said. “How could I be wrong? What am I missing? What other questions should I ask? Those are the ways, we know from psychological literature, that complement how humans think.”\\n\\nAmong the other potential benefits of AI is the chance to make medicine safer, according to David Bates, co-director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Learning Systems at Mass General Brigham. A recent study by Bates and colleagues showed that as many as one in four visits to Massachusetts hospitals results in some kind of patient harm. Many of those incidents trace back to adverse drug events.\\n\\n“AI should be able to look for medication-related issues and identify them much more accurately than we’re able to do right now,” said Bates, who is also a professor of medicine at the Medical School and of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\\n\\nDavid Bates, co-director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Learning Systems at Mass General Brigham “AI has a tendency to hallucinate, and that is a worry, because we don’t want things in people’s records that are not really there.” transcript Close transcript Transcript: DAVID BATES: AI has a great deal of promise. Burnout is rampant in many parts of medicine, especially, for example, primary care, and artificial intelligence will make many routine tasks like documentation much faster. Ambient scribes in particular are already doing that. There are also concerns about things going wrong. There are many ways that any time gains could be used, for example, just to increase physician workloads. It’s also very important that medical records be correct, and AI has a tendency to hallucinate, and that is a worry, because we don’t want things in people’s records that are not really there.\\n\\nAnother opportunity stems from AI’s growing competence in a mundane area: notetaking and summarization, according to Bernard Chang, dean for medical education at the Medical School.\\n\\nSystems for “ambient documentation” will soon be able to listen in on patient visits, record everything that is said and done, and generate an organized clinical note in real time. When symptoms are discussed, the AI can suggest diagnoses and courses of treatment. Later, the physician can review the summary for accuracy.\\n\\nAutomation of notes and summaries would benefit healthcare workers in more than one way, Chang said. It would ease doctors’ paperwork load, often cited as a cause of burnout, and it would reset the doctor-patient relationship. One of patients’ biggest complaints about office visits is the physician sitting at the computer, asking questions and recording the answers. Freed from the note-taking process, doctors could sit face-to-face with patients, opening a path to stronger connections.\\n\\n“It’s not the most magical use of AI,” Chang said. “We’ve all seen AI do something and said, ‘Wow, that’s amazing.’ This is not one of those things. But this program is being piloted at different ambulatory practices across the country and the early results are very promising. Physicians who feel overburdened and burnt out are starting to say, ‘You know what, this tool is going to help me.’”\\n\\nBernard Chang, Harvard Medical School Dean for Medical Education “I see AI as a transformative tool on par with the availability of the internet in terms of its effect on medicine and medical education.” transcript Close transcript Transcript: BERNARD CHANG: What most excites me about AI’s promise in medicine is that these technological tools will allow physicians to spend more time on the human aspects of the profession, which is sorely needed, while facilitating the ability to access information quickly, analyze large amounts of important data, and make the difficult connections necessary to consider the rare diagnoses, the less obvious treatment paradigms, and ultimately the optimal care for patients. In medical education, students can use AI tools to accelerate their learning and move more quickly beyond rote practice to higher levels of cognitive analysis on their way to becoming the most outstanding doctors of the future. Whether things might go long lies in our hands. We need to be cautious about hallucinations and misinformation, bias, an erosion of fundamentals in learning, and an over-reliance on machines. As a society, we need to be mindful of the environmental impacts of the high energy costs involved. On the whole, I see AI as a transformative tool on par with the availability of the internet in terms of its effect on medicine and medical education.\\n\\nThe bias threat\\n\\nFor all their power, LLMs are not ready to be left alone.\\n\\n“The technology is not good enough to have that safety level where you don’t need a knowledgeable human,” Rodman said. “I can understand where it might have gone aground. I can take a step further with the diagnosis. I can do that because I learned the hard way. In residency you make a ton of mistakes, but you learn from those mistakes. Our current system is incredibly suboptimal but it does train your brain. When people in medical school interact with things that can automate those processes — even if they’re, on average, better than humans — how are they going to learn?”\\n\\nDoctors and scientists also worry about bad information. Pervasive data bias stems from biomedicine’s roots in wealthy Western nations whose science was shaped by white men studying white men, says Leo Celi, an associate professor of medicine and a physician in the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\\n\\nLeo Celi, associate professor of medicine and a physician in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center’s Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine “We need to design human AI systems, rather than build algorithms. We have to be able to predict how humans will mess up.” transcript Close transcript Transcript: LEO CELI: AI could be the Trojan horse we’ve been waiting for to redesign systems from a clean slate. I am talking about systems for knowledge creation, health care delivery, and eduction, which are all quite broken. The legacy of AI is to make us better critical thinkers, by putting data at the front and center, and making the breadth and the depth of the problems crystal clear. But we need to design human AI systems, rather than build algorithms. We have to be able to predict how humans will mess up. The designs should be similar those of systems for aviation, road safety, space, nuclear power generation. We need psychologists, cognitive scientists, behavioral economists, anthropologists to design human AI systems.”\\n\\n“You need to understand the data before you can build artificial intelligence,” Celi said. “That gives us a new perspective of the design flaws of legacy systems for healthcare delivery, legacy systems for medical education. It becomes clear that the status quo is so bad — we knew it was bad and we’ve come to accept that it is a broken system — that all the promises of AI are going bust unless we recode the world itself.”\\n\\nCeli cited research on disparities in care between English-speaking and non-English speaking patients hospitalized with diabetes. Non-English speakers are woken up less frequently for blood sugar checks, raising the likelihood that changes will be missed. That impact is hidden, however, because the data isn’t obviously biased, only incomplete, even though it still contributes to a disparity in care.\\n\\n“They have one or two blood-sugar checks compared to 10 if you speak English well,” he said. “If you average it, the computers don’t see that this is a data imbalance. There’s so much missing context that experts may not be aware of what we call ‘data artifacts.’ This arises from a social patterning of the data generation process.”\\n\\nBates offered additional examples, including a skin cancer device that does a poor job detecting cancer on highly pigmented skin and a scheduling algorithm that wrongly predicted Black patients would have higher no-show rates, leading to overbooking and longer wait times.\\n\\n“Most clinicians are not aware that every medical device that we have is, to a certain degree, biased,” Celi said. “They don’t work well across all groups because we prototype them and we optimize them on, typically, college-age, white, male students. They were not optimized for an ICU patient who is 80 years old and has all these comorbidities, so why is there an expectation that the numbers they represent are objective ground truths?”\\n\\nThe exposure of deep biases in legacy systems presents an opportunity to get things right, Celi said. Accordingly, more researchers are pushing to ensure that clinical trials enroll diverse populations from geographically diverse locations.\\n\\nOne example is Beth Israel’s MIMIC database, which reflects the hospital’s diverse patient population. The tool, overseen by Celi, offers investigators de-identified electronic medical records — notes, images, test results — in an open-source format. It has been used in 10,000 studies by researchers all around the world and is set to expand to 14 additional hospitals, he said.\\n\\nAge of agility\\n\\nAs in the clinic, AI models used in the lab aren’t perfect, but they are opening pathways that hold promise to greatly accelerate scientific progress.\\n\\n“They provide instant insights at the atomic scale for some molecules that are still not accessible experimentally or that would take a tremendous amount of time and effort to generate,” said Marinka Zitnik, an associate professor of biomedical informatics at the Medical School. “These models provide in-silico predictions that are accurate, that scientists can then build upon and leverage in their scientific work. That, to me, just hints at this incredible moment that we are in.”\\n\\n”What is becoming increasingly important is to develop reliable, faithful benchmarks or techniques that allow us to evaluate how well the outputs of AI models behave in the real world.” Marinka Zitnik\\n\\nZitnik’s lab recently introduced Procyon, an AI model aimed at closing knowledge gaps around protein structures and their biological roles.\\n\\nUntil recently, it has been difficult for scientists to understand a protein’s shape — how the long molecules fold and twist onto themselves in three dimensions. This is important because the twists and turns expose portions of the molecule and hide others, making those sites easier or harder for other molecules to interact with, which affects the molecule’s chemical properties.\\n\\nMarinka Zitnik, assistant professor of biomedical informatics “Insights from research labs don’t always translate into effective treatments, and AI could amplify this gap if it’s not designed to bridge it.” transcript Close transcript Transcript: MARINKA ZITNIK: I am most excited about AI’s ability to learn and innovate on its own, instead of just analyzing existing knowledge. AI can generate new ideas, uncover hidden patterns, and propose solutions that humans might not consider. In biomedical research and drug development, this means AI could design new molecules, predict how these molecules interact with biological systems, and match treatments to patients with greater accuracy. By integrating information across genetics, proteins, all the way to clinical outcomes, AI can speed up discoveries in ways that was previously not possible. A major challenge, however, is that AI models tend to focus on problems that have already been extensively studied, while other important areas receive less attention. If we are not careful, medical advances may become concentrated in familiar areas, while other conditions remain under-explored, not because they are less important, but because there is less existing knowledge to guide AI systems. Another issue is that AI-driven drug design and treatment recommendations often rely on experimental findings generated in research labs that might not fully capture the complexity of real patients. Insights from research labs don’t always translate into effective treatments, and AI could amplify this gap if it’s not designed to bridge it. The opportunity is to build AI that makes discoveries and ensure that those discoveries lead to meaningful advances, bringing innovation to areas where it’s needed most.\\n\\nToday, predicting a protein’s shape — down to nearly every atom — from its known sequence of amino acids is feasible, Zitnik said. The major challenge is linking those structures to their functions and phenotypes across various biological settings and diseases. About 20 percent of human proteins have poorly defined functions, and an overwhelming share of research — 95 percent — is devoted to just 5,000 well-studied proteins.\\n\\n“We are addressing this gap by connecting molecular sequences and structures with functional annotations to predict protein phenotypes, helping move the field closer to being able to in-silico predict functions for each protein,” Zitnik said.\\n\\nA long-term goal for AI in the lab is the development of “AI scientists” that function as research assistants, with access to the entire body of scientific literature, the ability to integrate that knowledge with experimental results, and the capacity to suggest next steps. These systems could evolve into true collaborators, Zitnik said, noting that some models have already generated simple hypotheses. Her lab used Procyon, for example, to identify domains in the maltase glucoamylase protein that bind miglitol, a drug used to treat Type 2 diabetes. In another project, the team showed that Procyon could functionally annotate poorly characterized proteins implicated in Parkinson’s disease. The tool’s broad range of capabilities is possible because it was trained on massive experimental data sets and the entire scientific literature, resources far exceeding what humans can read and analyze, Zitnik said.\\n\\nThe classroom comes before the lab, and the AI dynamic of flexibility, innovation, and constant learning is also being applied to education. The Medical School has introduced a course dealing with AI in healthcare; added a Ph.D. track on AI in medicine; is planning a “tutor bot” to provide supplemental material beyond lectures; and is developing a virtual patient on which students can practice before their first nerve-wracking encounter with the real thing. Meanwhile, Rodman is leading a steering group on the use of generative AI in medical education.\\n\\nThese initiatives are a good start, he said. Still, the rapid evolution of AI technology makes it difficult to prepare students for careers that will span 30 years.\\n\\n“The Harvard view, which is my view as well, is that we can give people the basics, but we just have to encourage agility and prepare people for a future that changes rapidly,” Rodman said. “Probably the best thing we can do is prepare people to expect the unexpected.”  \n",

     The UK recently announced its AI Opportunities Action Plan, outlining the next phase of AI development for Britain. The ambition is to use AI for economic prosperity, improved public services, and increased opportunity. The UK already has the groundwork to be a leader in AI as it benefits from high-quality research and engineering talent, particularly in AI for science and robotics. As the UK makes a concerted push on AI, the US has announced $500 billion in private capital funding to grow AI infrastructure.\\n\\nThis increased focus from plans and investments will impact the way that AI is utilized. As AI grows increasingly pivotal in technology, offering tools and methodologies that can enhance precision and adaptability across various domains, there are three areas where we can anticipate growth: generative AI, verification & validation, and control system designs.\\n\\nLucas Garcia Social Links Navigation Principal Product Manager for AI at MathWorks.\\n\\nGenAI moves onto block diagrams, 3D models, and flow charts\\n\\nWhile the initial focus on text-based GenAI continues to influence software-centric workflows, its impact on tools with higher-level abstractions is lagging. In 2025, we expect continued progress in applying GenAI to “no code” tools such as block diagrams, 3D models, and flowcharts. These tools enable organizations to graphically represent complex systems, effortlessly edit components, and manage the inherent complexity.\\n\\nFurthermore, they are essential to productivity and validate confidence in system-level performance. Integrating GenAI with these tools will further increase their productivity while keeping the interfaces familiar to end users. More tools in this space will integrate AI copilots that can understand engineering models and assist in their design and management.\\n\\nLeveraging verification and validation for AI compliance\\n\\nIndustry governing bodies are introducing AI compliance requirements, frameworks, and guidance as the integration of AI into safety-critical systems in automotive, healthcare, and aerospace applications accelerates. In response, technology leaders must prioritize the introduction and implementation of Verification and Validation (V&V) processes to ensure their AI components are ready for deployment under all conditions and can meet potential reliability, transparency, and bias compliance standards.\\n\\nV&V is crucial for verifying the robustness of deep learning models and detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, particularly in safety-critical applications. Robustness verification is crucial because neural networks can misclassify inputs with minor, imperceptible changes, known as adversarial examples. For instance, a subtle perturbation in a chest X-ray image might lead a model to incorrectly identify pneumonia as normal. Engineers can provide mathematical proof of a model’s consistency and test these scenarios using formal verification methods, such as abstract interpretation. This process enhances the model's reliability and ensures compliance with safety standards by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.\\n\\nOut-of-distribution detection is equally important, as it enables AI systems to recognize and appropriately handle unfamiliar inputs. This capability is vital for maintaining accuracy and safety, especially when unexpected data leads to erroneous predictions. The ability to discern between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data ensures that AI models can defer uncertain cases to human experts, thereby preventing potential failures in critical applications.\\n\\nFocusing on V&V allows organizations to comply with AI frameworks and standards while advancing product development within their industry. A proactive compliance approach ensures that AI systems are reliable, safe, and ethically sound, maintaining a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving landscape.\\n\\nThe rise of AI-based reduced order models in engineering\\n\\nThe trend of using AI-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs) is expected to grow, driven by advances in AI technology and computational power. Organizations leveraging these models will enhance system performance and reliability, as well as the efficiency and efficacy of system design and simulation.\\n\\nThe primary driver behind this shift is the need to manage increasingly complex systems while maintaining high levels of precision and speed. Traditional computer-aided engineering (CAE) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are accurate but computationally heavy and suboptimal for real-time applications. AI-based ROMs address this by cutting computational demands while maintaining accuracy. Organizations can use these models to simulate complex phenomena more quickly, facilitating faster iterations and optimizations.\\n\\nFurthermore, AI-based ROMs' highly versatile ability to adapt to varying parameters and conditions enhances their applicability across different scenarios. This adaptability is particularly valuable in the aerospace, automotive, and energy fields, where engineered systems often involve intricate physical phenomena that require detailed modeling and simulation. For example, businesses that design and test aircraft components, such as wings or engines, can simulate aerodynamic properties and stress factors more efficiently, allowing engineers to iterate and optimize designs quickly. Additionally, AI-based ROMs can adapt to various flight conditions, making them versatile tools for testing multiple scenarios using the same model. This capability accelerates the development process, reduces costs, and enhances the reliability of the final product.\\n\\nAI breaks down barriers in complex system control\\n\\nAI’s continued integration into control design will transform the field, particularly in managing complex systems and embedded applications. Traditionally, control system design relied on first-principles modeling that required deep knowledge and understanding of the system. Data-driven modeling was largely limited to linear models that are valid only in a small part of the design envelope. AI is transforming this landscape by enabling the creation of accurate nonlinear models from data. This enables the creation of highly accurate models that combine first principles and data and are valid over the entire operating range. This advancement allows for better control of complex systems.\\n\\nSimultaneously, the growing computational power of microcontrollers is facilitating the embedding of AI algorithms directly into systems. This integration is particularly impactful in the consumer electronics and automotive industries, where highly responsive systems are becoming the norm. For instance, AI is embedded in power tools to monitor and react to environmental changes, such as sudden material density shifts that could pose safety risks. These tools use embedded AI to autonomously adjust their operation, enhancing safety and performance.\\n\\nThe convergence of AI with complex system control and embedded systems ushers in an era of more robust, adaptive, and intelligent control design. Organizations can now create systems that learn and adapt in real-time, providing unprecedented precision and efficiency. This creates an environment where AI-driven solutions address traditional control problems, paving the way for smarter, more integrated systems across various engineering domains.\\n\\nThere should be excitement about AI’s continued maturation and progression. The fusion of physics insights with AI models will enhance transparency and adaptability, reducing the “black box” nature of traditional approaches. The democratization of AI tools enables organizations to access advanced capabilities more easily. These advancements will elevate AI's role in engineering and enable technical professionals to build better engineered systems more rapidly and effectively.\\n\\nWe've featured the best AI phone.\\n\\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Any statements made herein that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about Radware’s plans, outlook, beliefs, or opinions, are forward-looking statements. Generally, forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “estimates,” “plans,” and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “should,” “would,” “may,” and “could.” For example, when we say in this press release that we are committed to pushing the boundaries in delivering state-of-the-art application protection, we are using forward-looking statements. Because such statements deal with future events, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and actual results, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, could differ materially from Radware’s current forecasts and estimates. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: the impact of global economic conditions, including as a result of the state of war declared in Israel in October 2023 and instability in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, and the tensions between China and Taiwan; our dependence on independent distributors to sell our products; our ability to manage our anticipated growth effectively; a shortage of components or manufacturing capacity could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders or increase our manufacturing costs; our business may be affected by sanctions, export controls, and similar measures, targeting Russia and other countries and territories, as well as other responses to Russia’s military conflict in Ukraine, including indefinite suspension of operations in Russia and dealings with Russian entities by many multi-national businesses across a variety of industries; the ability of vendors to provide our hardware platforms and components for the manufacture of our products; our ability to attract, train, and retain highly qualified personnel; intense competition in the market for cyber security and application delivery solutions and in our industry in general, and changes in the competitive landscape; our ability to develop new solutions and enhance existing solutions; the impact to our reputation and business in the event of real or perceived shortcomings, defects, or vulnerabilities in our solutions, if our end-users experience security breaches, if our information technology systems and data, or those of our service providers and other contractors, are compromised by cyber-attackers or other malicious actors or by a critical system failure; outages, interruptions, or delays in hosting services; the risks associated with our global operations, such as difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations, compliance costs arising from host country laws or regulations, partial or total expropriation, export duties and quotas, local tax exposure, economic or political instability, including as a result of insurrection, war, natural disasters, and major environmental, climate, or public health concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; our net losses in the past two years and possibility we may incur losses in the future; a slowdown in the growth of the cyber security and application delivery solutions market or in the development of the market for our cloud-based solutions; long sales cycles for our solutions; risks and uncertainties relating to acquisitions or other investments; risks associated with doing business in countries with a history of corruption or with foreign governments; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; risks associated with undetected defects or errors in our products; our ability to protect our proprietary technology; intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties; laws, regulations, and industry standards affecting our business; compliance with open source and third-party licenses; and other factors and risks over which we may have little or no control. This list is intended to identify only certain of the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ.

                                                                                                                                                           A new report identifying commercial litigation waves likely to pick up steam in 2025 highlights one particular theme that could further lengthen the tail of general liability claims for insurers writing policies for contractors and builders.\\n\\nThe 2025 “Commercial Litigation Outlook,“ published by the law firm Seyfarth Shaw provides an annual look at the legal landscape in multiple areas, including Gen AI, privacy, healthcare, cannabis, intellectual property, securities, consumer protection and class actions, real estate, and antitrust, among others.\\n\\nIn the real estate section of the report, the firm notes the disputes over defective construction are likely to increase in 2025.\\n\\nWhile the report describes construction defect litigation as “evergreen,” several factors could spur more of it, including the focus of President Trump’s administration on immigration. Construction defect litigation rises in years following shortages of skilled labor—and that’s been in short supply in the construction industry for most of the last decade, the report states, also noting that 30-40 percent of all construction workers in the U .S . are immigrants, “with an undetermined number who are undocumented.” (Editor’s Note: The National Association of Home Builders offers similar figures on its website.)\\n\\nThe construction labor shortage has hovered around half-a-million workers since 2023, the report says.\\n\\nThe Seyfarth Shaw lawyers also pointed to the high demand for rebuilding in areas that have been impacted by recent hurricanes and wildfires as another factor that could fuel future construction defect litigation. In California, the urgent need to replace housing has has already resulted in loosening or elimination of certain requirements for rebuilding, which in turn may increase the risk of defective construction.\\n\\nNoting that defect claims tend to have a one to three-year lag time, claims could show up in 2025 and beyond.\\n\\nThroughout much of the report, authors refer to actions by the current administration that may be changing the legal landscape in various areas—for example, shifting some types of actions to state courts.\\n\\n“Federal ESG litigation has, for the moment, had its day,” the firm said in a media statement. “SEC greenhouse emissions rules announced just a year ago will probably gather dust, meaning individual states are set to become the favored fora for ESG-related allegations, such as corporate greenwashing.”\\n\\nThe report writers also expect consumer fraud class actions based on testing for alleged harmful substances like PFAS and heavy metals, again highlighting state-specific regulations that could spur litigation.\\n\\n“Businesses selling consumer products in California should be aware of the state’s specific regulation of PFAS-containing products, including new requirements effective in 2025. Current laws already prohibit or require labeling and disclosures for certain PFAS-containing items, such as children’s products and cookware. Starting in 2025, these regulations will expand to cover more products, including textiles, clothing, and cosmetics,” the report says. “Given growing concerns over PFAS exposures, businesses will need to ensure that their products fully comply with all state and federal PFAS regulations, including upcoming California requirements.”\\n\\nWhether at the federal or state level, consumer fraud lawsuits around PFAS and other substances allege two main theories of deception—that product claims of being “pure” and “organic” were false based on the presence of the substance, or simply that defendants failed to disclose the presence of the substance in its product.\\n\\nOther commercial litigation trends highlighted in the Seyfarth Shaw report are two that could directly impact insurers as defendants—privacy lawsuits and Generative AI challenges.\\n\\n“With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, telematics, and advanced tracking technologies, plaintiffs’ attorneys are leveraging both new and longstanding privacy statutes to address emerging privacy risks,” the report says, also noting heightened regulatory scrutiny that could extend to insurers relying on IoT and telematics devices.\\n\\nRelated articles: Allstate, Arity Legal Troubles Mount; Class Action Filings Allege Privacy Violations; Unappreciated Gen AI Risks: Carbon Emissions and D&O Litigation\\n\\n“In 2025, privacy litigation is expected to grow in volume and scope, with corporations facing unprecedented challenges in collecting, managing, and safeguarding sensitive data,” the report says.\\n\\nWith respect to Generative AI, the Seyfarth Shaw focuses on the use of AI in bringing and defending lawsuits—”in everything from discovery and disclosure to the rising potential for immaculately forged evidence.”\\n\\nRelated articles: Defendants, Insurers Risk Falling Behind on AI for Litigation\\n\\nHere, the report notes, however, that the Trump administration has “removed guardrails” in place under the former president, Joe Biden, and “embraced AI as central to the U.S, economy and national security.”\\n\\nOf particular interest to D&O insurers, the report notes that business bankruptcies jumped in 2024. With “record high consumer debt, lingering inflation, labor shortages, and high interest rates, that bankruptcy number has nowhere to go but up,” the report authors said.  \n",

increasing pressure of global climate change, water conservation (WC) in semi-arid regions is experiencing unprecedented levels of stress. WC involves complex, nonlinear interactions among ecosystem components like vegetation, soil structure, and topography, complicating research. This study introduces a novel approach combining InVEST modeling, spatiotemporal transfer of Water Conservation Reserves (WCR), and deep learning to uncover regional WC patterns and driving mechanisms. The InVEST model evaluates Xiong’an New Area’s WC characteristics from 2000 to 2020, showing a 74% average increase in WC depth with an inverted “V” spatial distribution. Spatiotemporal analysis identifies temporal changes, spatial patterns of WCR and land use, and key protection areas, revealing that the WCR in Xiong’an New Area primarily shifts from the lowest WCR areas to lower WCR areas. The potential enhancement areas of WCR are concentrated in the northern region. Deep learning quantifies data complexity, highlighting critical factors like land use, precipitation, and drought influencing WC. This detailed approach enables the development of personalized WC zones and strategies, offering new insights into managing complex spatial and temporal WC data.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nWater Conservation (WC) refers to the ability of a region or a specific ecosystem to protect and maintain water resources in its natural state[1]. In semi-arid regions, where precipitation is limited and evaporation rates are high, the natural availability of water resources is severely constrained, making water conservation particularly critical. Safeguarding regional WC is crucial not only for environmental protection but also for economic development[2] and global environmental sustainability[3]. The ecosystems in semi-arid regions, such as sparse vegetation and fragile soils, further complicate water conservation efforts. A scientific understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of water conservation reserves (WCR) is crucial for regional water resource security[4], ecosystem health[5], and climate regulation[6]. However, due to the combined influence of factors such as climate, topography, soil properties, and land use, the simulation of regional WC is highly dynamic, complex, and uncertain[7]. This poses a significant challenge to the protection of the region’s water resources.\\n\\nTraditional methods for assessing regional WC primarily rely on manual monitoring of hydrological data, field sampling, and water extraction techniques to evaluate the area’s ability to conserve water resources[8]. However, these methods rely on manual operations, which not only require significant labor but are also vulnerable to factors such as climate change and complex terrain. As a result, the data obtained often have uneven spatiotemporal distribution, leading to deviations in the accuracy of the measurement results. Therefore, traditional methods face greater challenges when facing the large-scale and dynamically changing WC assessment. The development of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technologies in the field of modeling has led to a more effective assessment of WC[9]. By using RS data and GIS technology, spatial and temporal variations in groundwater resources can be analyzed in more detail, providing a more accurate assessment of WC and overcoming the spatial and temporal constraints and manual labor problems of traditional methods[10]. For decades, the study of WC through “modeling and visualization” has gradually become a new research trend. Current research mainly relies on models based on simulation and analysis of WC, which can be broadly categorized into hydrological models and ecosystem service models. Traditional hydrological models, such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model[11] and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model[12], focus on runoff simulation and water resource management. They typically emphasize physical processes like dynamic changes in water resources, pollutant diffusion, and soil moisture distribution, but lack quantitative and comprehensive assessments of ecosystem service values. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs Model (InVEST)[13] focuses on the quantification and visualization of ecosystem services, enabling the quantitative assessment and multidimensional analysis of ecosystem services. It is especially useful in fields such as environmental protection, sustainable development, and ecological restoration, as it integrates ecological, economic, and social factors to provide more comprehensive decision support[14]. However, most studies[15–17] using the InVEST model to assess regional WC primarily focus on evaluating the overall WC capacity of the region, with limited analysis of the temporal changes in WC within the same region. Our goal is to fill this gap by classifying WCR into different levels and analyzing trends in these changes. This approach will guide land use planning, assess the priority and development of WCR.\\n\\nAnother challenge lies in unearthing the driving mechanisms of WC, and while meteorological[18]and soil factors[19,20]have been recognized as important predictors of WC, few observations have been made of the cross-correlation of each factor with WC. This may be due to the nonlinear relationships[21,22]between many parameters and WC, which complicates the determination of simple linear relationships between parameters and WC. In analyzing the drivers, most scholars usually use traditional statistical methods[23–25]. Jia, et al.[26]used principal component analysis to identify precipitation, evapotranspiration, and forest and grasses as the main drivers affecting water yield. Alireza Daneshi and Yanqing Lang et al.[27,28] Use of scenario analysis to assess the impact of climate and land use on regional WC. While these method help to understand the main patterns of change in the data, it does not allow for a specific degree of influence of each characteristic on the target variable. In the face of large datasets, it is difficult for these methods to account for nonlinear relationships. In recent decades, machine learning has gained popularity in water resources management[29], as it can effectively handle nonlinear processes[30,31]. Xie, et al.[32]used a tree-modeling importance analysis to identify weather as the main driver influencing changes in WC, which not only accounted for nonlinear effects, but also provided a specific degree of influence of each characteristic, but it still did not account for the factors’ interactions. In addition, most of the studies[16,33,34]only discuss the influence mechanism of the main drivers and lack detailed analysis of the specific influence mechanism of individual factors on WC capacity. In contrast, deep learning is uniquely positioned to analyze complex ecosystems through its multilayer neural network structure[35]. Despite significant progress in other areas, deep learning is still less frequently applied to assess and analyze water cycle drivers[36,37]. In the field of WC assessment, decision makers need a clear understanding of model-driven mechanisms in key decision areas such as ecosystem stability and WC management in order to develop reliable management strategies. However, there is a lack of physical explanation of the deep learning model assessment process[38]. Research has increasingly shifted towards explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technologies. XAI helps users understand the driving factors behind model predictions by revealing the importance of features and their relationships[39]. Techniques like Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) have been applied to interpret black-box models. LIME focuses on providing local explanations[40], Grad-CAM is useful for image feature interpretation[41], and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) offers limited readability under multidimensional features and cannot provide global feature importance. In contrast, SHAP does not have these limitations. Derived from cooperative game theory, SHAP is used to determine each participant’s contribution to a collaborative task. It can provide local explanations for individual samples and global explanations across the entire dataset. Therefore, we aim to fill this gap by modeling the solution of the regional WC drivers and introducing XAI for interpretation. K-fold cross-validation and Monte Carlo were utilized to verify the accuracy and stability of the model.\\n\\nThis study focuses on the Xiong’an New Area in Hebei Province, China, exploring the spatiotemporal patterns of water conservation (WC) in a semi-arid region and its driving factors. Unlike traditional analysis methods, this research incorporates the InVEST model to include the perspective of critical zone transitions, offering a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of regional WC and water conservation reserves (WCR). Additionally, by integrating deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, the study reveals the underlying driving mechanisms. The introduction of deep neural networks (DNN) and XAI methods, particularly the SHAP model, not only enhances the accuracy of hydrological analysis but also effectively addresses nonlinear and uncertain factors, overcoming the limitations of traditional hydrological simulations in handling complex data. This approach improves the transparency and interpretability of the model, providing new insights into WC and assisting policymakers in formulating more precise water resource management strategies to promote regional sustainable development.  \n",

The increasing convenience of online booking systems, coupled with the rising awareness of sustainable landscaping practices, is expected to further bolster market growth, making the Lawn Vacuum Rental Industry a promising sector in the years ahead.\\n\\nKey Market Drivers\\n\\n1. Increasing Demand for Outdoor Maintenance Services\\n\\nThe rapid pace of urbanization has amplified the need for aesthetically maintained outdoor spaces, particularly in residential and commercial areas. Homeowners, property managers, and businesses are prioritizing efficient lawn care solutions, leading to an upsurge in demand for specialized lawn maintenance equipment. According to industry estimates, the broader lawn care industry in the United States alone is projected to surpass $90 billion by 2025, highlighting a significant market opportunity for rental services.\\n\\n2. Cost-Effective Rental Model Gaining Popularity\\n\\nPurchasing high-quality lawn vacuums can be a substantial financial investment, particularly for homeowners who require them only for seasonal maintenance. The rental model allows consumers to access advanced equipment without incurring the upfront costs of ownership, making it a more practical and economical choice. This trend is particularly strong in the commercial landscaping sector, where businesses seek to optimize operational costs by leasing specialized equipment instead of purchasing it outright.\\n\\n3. Growing Emphasis on Environmental Sustainability\\n\\nEnvironmental consciousness among consumers and businesses has led to a growing preference for sustainable lawn care solutions. Lawn vacuums help reduce the need for chemical fertilizers by efficiently collecting organic debris that can be composted, promoting eco-friendly waste management. The rental model aligns with this sustainability trend by reducing excessive consumption and encouraging shared resource utilization, further driving market growth.\\n\\n4. Technological Advancements in Equipment\\n\\nThe evolution of smart lawn vacuum technology has significantly enhanced user experience and efficiency. Innovations such as app-controlled settings, GPS tracking, self-propelled mechanisms, and enhanced mulching capabilities are attracting a broader customer base. Additionally, improved motor efficiency and filtration systems contribute to better performance, making these machines more appealing to environmentally conscious consumers and professional landscapers alike.\\n\\nChallenges and Restraints\\n\\n1. Seasonal Fluctuations in Demand\\n\\nThe demand for lawn vacuum rentals is highly seasonal, with peak usage during spring and autumn when leaf and debris accumulation is at its highest. During off-season months, rental companies often experience lower revenue streams, making it crucial to implement strategic inventory management and marketing campaigns to sustain business operations throughout the year.\\n\\n2. Competition from Alternative Lawn Maintenance Methods\\n\\nConsumers have access to a wide range of lawn care solutions, including traditional lawn mowers, leaf blowers, and manual raking. While lawn vacuums offer superior efficiency and environmental benefits, they must compete with these cost-effective alternatives. Rental providers must focus on educating consumers about the advantages of their services and positioning their offerings as superior solutions.\\n\\n3. High Maintenance and Operational Costs\\n\\nFor rental companies, maintaining an extensive fleet of lawn vacuums can be costly. Regular servicing, repairs, and upgrades are necessary to ensure that equipment remains in optimal condition. Older models may require frequent maintenance, leading to increased operational expenses. Companies must balance pricing strategies to remain competitive while covering these costs effectively.\\n\\n4. Limited Consumer Awareness and Market Penetration\\n\\nDespite the benefits of lawn vacuum rentals, many potential users remain unaware of their advantages compared to conventional methods. Raising consumer awareness through digital marketing campaigns, social media engagement, and educational content can help rental companies expand their customer base and increase market adoption.\\n\\nGrowth Opportunities in the Industry\\n\\n1. Expanding Target Markets Beyond Residential Consumers\\n\\nRental services have the potential to cater to a broader customer base, including businesses, municipal authorities, parks, golf courses, and educational institutions. Collaborations with commercial landscaping companies and local governments can result in long-term rental contracts, stabilizing revenue streams and reducing the impact of seasonal demand fluctuations.\\n\\n2. Integration of Smart Technology in Rental Equipment\\n\\nAdvancements in IoT-enabled smart lawn vacuums present a major growth opportunity. Features such as real-time performance monitoring, remote-controlled operations, and AI-driven maintenance alerts can enhance user convenience and equipment longevity. Rental platforms that invest in these technologies can differentiate themselves in a competitive market and attract tech-savvy consumers.\\n\\n3. Adoption of Subscription-Based Rental Models\\n\\nIntroducing flexible subscription-based rental plans can enhance customer retention and provide a consistent revenue stream for businesses. Tiered pricing structures catering to both occasional users and professional landscapers can create a more sustainable business model and encourage long-term customer relationships.\\n\\n4. Emphasizing Sustainable Practices and Eco-Friendly Solutions\\n\\nWith the increasing focus on sustainability, rental companies can align their services with environmentally conscious consumer preferences. Offering biodegradable collection bags, partnering with composting initiatives, or providing incentives for eco-friendly practices can enhance brand appeal and attract sustainability-focused customers.\\n\\n5. Strengthening Digital Presence and E-Commerce Capabilities\\n\\nThe growth of online rental platforms and mobile applications has transformed how consumers access lawn maintenance services. Rental companies that invest in user-friendly booking systems, real-time inventory management, and customer review platforms can enhance customer engagement and improve overall service efficiency. Utilizing social media marketing and targeted digital advertising can further boost market visibility and drive rental inquiries.\\n\\nRegional Market Insights\\n\\n1.

                                New research from technology innovators Amadeus explores what travelers are looking for from a trip and how technology can make those ambitions come true. The report– Travel Dreams – draws on input from 6,000 travelers from US, China, India, UK, France and Germany to understand how they choose where to visit, how they want to book and what factors most impact a trip once they are on the road.\\n\\nThe study finds that two-thirds of hotel guests (63%) are willing to pay extra for features such as a specific view or floor, to have an Xbox in their room or to have local attractions added to their package. The research shows these features could add around 12% to the average daily rate (ADR) charged by the hotel, which could increase revenues by over $5,300 per room*, per year, for an average mid-range hotel chain looking to sell these extra features.\\n\\nThe channels now driving travel are changing too. Social media ads and travel influencers have risen the most in influence in the last five years, while newspapers, in-person travel agents and TV ads are all seeing fluctuations in importance as a source of inspiration for a travelers’ next destination.\\n\\nLeisure travelers crave the personal touch from hotels, with 50% of travelers saying that receiving a personalized service and welcome would be top of the list in achieving their ideal hotel experience. Over half of guests (52%) said they would be willing to share personal data in return for tailored deals (with fewer people, 40%, open to doing so for a reduced price). Nearly half (48%) of all leisure guests shared a preference for a traditional check-in desk, with a person to talk them through the hotel amenities.\\n\\nBusiness travelers are looking for more technology in their pursuit of efficiency, with 71% of business travelers interested in a form of online or self-service check-in. Nearly a quarter (22%) of business travelers want the option of paying with crypto currency or a digital wallet in the future – suggesting the payments landscape may also be shifting.\\n\\nLack of insurance is costing travelers real money. The global travelers surveyed said the average amount they think they have lost due to not having travel insurance stands at an average of US$1,210 per person – a sizeable sum. For the average Chinese traveler specifically, they put this figure at over $2,500 per person.\\n\\nTravelers want to embrace virtual reality and artificial intelligence.\\n\\n82% of business travelers and 66% of leisure travelers said they would like to explore a destination before arrival with a virtual tour. Half of all travelers said they would now turn to AI to tell them about the best places for dinner at their destination. 18% of travelers said they would even ask an AI assistant to write a review on their behalf about a hotel or dinner they had experienced on their trip.\\n\\nCommenting on the findings, Francisco Pérez-Lozao Rüter, President, Hospitality, Amadeus, says: “From the moment travelers begin thinking about their trip to the time they return home, our mission is to empower the industry to be able to provide exceptional experiences at every step of the journey.\\n\\n“Projects of this kind show how diverse people’s needs are, depending on key factors such as the purpose of their trip, their age or where they are from. By combining this knowledge with innovative new technology, hoteliers, destinations, mobility and travel protection providers have real opportunities to drive profitable demand, create personalized trips for guests and connect the dots across the end-to-end experience for people. Working in lock step with our customers, together we are transforming travel.”\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFindings for Travel Dreams are based on input from 6,000 travelers around the world. Collaborating with Opinium Research, researchers questioned a combination of business and leisure travelers in six key markets – USA, China, Germany, UK, France and India – to deepen understanding of the end-to-end travel experience.\\n\\nTo deliver an industry perspective on the key topics covered in the report, interviews were conducted with executives from Amadeus, Flemings Hotels, Lexis Hotels, The Trans Hotel Group, Marcus Hotels, Geronimo Hospitality Group, Core Hospitality, Hegg Companies, Europcar, ProColombia and AXA Partners.\\n\\n* To calculate the potential revenue that could be added by selling hotel attributes, the following calculation was used, based on Amadeus Demand360® data:\\n\\nAverage hotel occupancy worldwide stood at 69%, or 252 days, in 2024.\\n\\nAverage daily rate worldwide in 2024 stood at $178, or $44,856 per annum.\\n\\nTherefore, if travelers are willing to spend an average of 12% on top of ADR for attributes, this could equate to an additional $5,383 per room, per year.\\n\\nAbout Amadeus\\n\\nAmadeus makes the experience of travel better for everyone, everywhere by inspiring innovation, partnerships and responsibility to people, places and planet.\\n\\nOur technology powers the travel and tourism industry.

But beyond recycling and shopping organic, it's hard to know what to do to make a meaningful difference during the climate crisis.\\n\\nThat's where artificial intelligence can come in. While it's important to remember that AI itself is a culprit and contributor -- consuming more energy than a Google search and extra water to cool data centers -- these tools can also help educate and inspire behavioral change, if used appropriately.\\n\\nChatbots like ChatGPT are more personal and interactive than a Google search, especially if you're logged in and it has access to your history, or you've trained it with previous conversations.\\n\\nUse ChatGPT to inspire a zero-waste lifestyle\\n\\nThere are a few ways you can use AI to guide you in reducing waste. I tested out three:\\n\\nResearch: Ask questions and become educated about environmentally friendly households. Advice: Share consumption, usage and household habits. A plan: Ask it to create a plan for your household.\\n\\nWhat you ask about AI will depend on where you want to reduce waste -- food, deliveries, financial, plastic, tech, etc. If you want to reduce eating out, you could feed ChatGPT an Excel spreadsheet of your last 90 days of grocery and restaurant charges to see where you could save, or upload a photo of your fridge to create a weekly menu that minimizes food waste and reuses your leftovers.\\n\\nIf you're unsure where to start, do some reflection of your goals first.\\n\\nBecome an eco-friendly household with AI\\n\\nHere's how to turn ChatGPT into your family's environmental \"coach.\"\\n\\nAsk questions and educate yourself\\n\\nYou can go straight to ChatGPT and learn about waste reduction strategies. Ask questions such as:\\n\\nWhat is an environmentally friendly household?\\n\\nHow do I know if we waste too much?\\n\\nHow can we balance replacing household items with sustainable options vs. waiting until they're broken?\\n\\nWhat is the usual electricity bill and water bill for a family of three in NYC?\\n\\nWhat are some lesser-known tips to switch to an environmentally friendly lifestyle?\\n\\nYou'll get answers like: Tracking your waste (garbage output, recycling and composting), figuring out whether your water usage and energy bills are higher than similar households, seeing if you \"over-rely\" on takeout or regularly throw out spoiled food, avoiding impulse buying and staying away from single-use plastics or paper towels.\\n\\nWhat's cool about chatbots is you'll get ideas mid-conversation. For example, we often have to throw out cooked rice or leftover burger buns. Instead of buying brioche buns because we're craving homemade burgers, I could ask ChatGPT for recipe ideas, so they don't go to waste.\\n\\nYum!\\n\\nChatGPT/Screenshot by CNET\\n\\nShare your household habits\\n\\nNext, share your family's household habits relating to consumption, cooking, trash/recycling, plastic usage, products and areas for improvements.\\n\\nThis is an example prompt: \"Here's some information about us. We're a household of two. We cook 80% of our meals at home but do enjoy eating out a couple times per week. We walk to Whole Foods most days to get items fresh for dinner, rather than meal plan. We live in a pre-war building that often has plumbing issues, so we buy 1 gallon of bottled water every day. We use the Yuka app to check the health product quality of the items we buy. We're not big consumers but we do use Amazon Prime regularly for convenience because we don't have a car.\"\\n\\nIt came back to me with three ideas (that I already knew): Get a high-quality water filter, bring reusable bags to the grocery store and reduce my Amazon orders.\\n\\nYou often have to push ChatGPT for less generic answers. You might find one gem in there, like some hacks for keeping vegetables fresh or reusing scraps.\\n\\nOur two biggest problems are buying single-use plastic and shopping on Amazon a few times a month, so that'll be the focus of our household plan.\\n\\nThis exercise of chatting with AI will give you ideas, too. For example, putting all Amazon orders in a cart and ordering once a month, or bringing reusable bags to Whole Foods.\\n\\nMake a plan for your household\\n\\nYou could ask it to create a three-month plan and focus on some big wins or ask it to come up with a list of 30 ways to reduce waste over 30 days.\\n\\nYou'll have to pick the ones that are applicable to you and tell ChatGPT to generate new ideas. For example, we already use bar soap instead of a plastic soap container.\\n\\nChatGPT/Screenshot by CNET\\n\\nChatGPT/Screenshot by CNET\\n\\nPick the hacks that apply to your household, then feed it back into ChatGPT. Tell it \"these are the ones I like\" to come up with more ideas.\\n\\nKeep pushing it until you have 30 solid strategies to test in your home.  \n",

build open AI models to transform the way we make, move and use electricity.\\n\\nThe power and utilities sector keeps the lights on for the world’s populations and industries. As the global energy landscape evolves, so must the tools it relies on.\\n\\nTo advance the next generation of electricity generation and distribution, many of the industry’s members are joining forces through the creation of the Open Power AI Consortium. The consortium includes energy companies, technology companies and researchers developing AI applications to tackle domain-specific challenges, such as adapting to an increased deployment of distributed energy resources and significant load growth on electric grids.\\n\\nLed by independent, nonprofit energy R&D organization EPRI, the consortium aims to spur AI adoption in the power sector through a collaborative effort to build open models using curated, industry-specific data. The initiative was launched today at NVIDIA GTC, a global AI conference taking place through Friday, March 21, in San Jose, California.\\n\\n“Over the next decade, AI has the great potential to revolutionize the power sector by delivering the capability to enhance grid reliability, optimize asset performance, and enable more efficient energy management,” said Arshad Mansoor, EPRI’s president and CEO. “With the Open Power AI Consortium, EPRI and its collaborators will lead this transformation, driving innovation toward a more resilient and affordable energy future.”\\n\\nAs part of the consortium, EPRI, NVIDIA and Articul8, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, are developing a set of domain-specific, multimodal large language models trained on massive libraries of proprietary energy and electrical engineering data from EPRI that can help utilities streamline operations, boost energy efficiency and improve grid resiliency.\\n\\nThe first version of an industry-first open AI model for electric and power systems was developed using hundreds of NVIDIA H100 GPUs and is expected to soon be available in early access as an NVIDIA NIM microservice.\\n\\n“Working with EPRI, we aim to leverage advanced AI tools to address today’s unique industry challenges, positioning us at the forefront of innovation and operational excellence,” said Vincent Sorgi, CEO of PPL Corporation and EPRI board chair.\\n\\nPPL is a leading U.S. energy company that provides electricity and natural gas to more than 3.6 million customers in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Rhode Island and Virginia.\\n\\nThe Open AI Consortium’s Executive Advisory Committee includes executives from over 20 energy companies such as Duke Energy, Exelon, Pacific Gas & Electric Company and Portland General Electric, as well as leading tech companies such as AWS, Oracle and Microsoft. The consortium plans to further expand its global member base.\\n\\nPowering Up AI to Energize Operations, Drive Innovation\\n\\nGlobal energy consumption is projected to grow by nearly 4% annually through 2027, according to the International Energy Agency. To support this surge in demand, electricity providers are looking to enhance the resiliency of power infrastructure, balance diverse energy sources and expand the grid’s capacity.\\n\\nAI agents trained on thousands of documents specific to this sector — including academic research, industry regulations and standards, and technical documents — can enable utility and energy companies to more quickly assess energy needs and prepare the studies and permits required to improve infrastructure.\\n\\n“We can bring AI to the global power sector in a much more accelerated way by working together to develop foundation models for the industry, and collaborating with the power sector to y apply solutions tailored to its unique needs,” Mansoor said.\\n\\nUtilities could tap the consortium’s model to help accelerate interconnection studies, which analyze the feasibility and potential impact of connecting new generators to the existing electric grid. The process varies by region but can take up to four years to complete. By introducing AI agents that can support the analysis, the consortium aims to cut this timeline down by at least 5x.\\n\\nThe AI model could also be used to support the preparation of licenses, permits, environmental studies and utility rate cases, where energy companies seek regulatory approval and public comment on proposed changes to electricity rates.\\n\\nBeyond releasing datasets and models, the consortium also aims to develop a standardized framework of benchmarks to help utilities, researchers and other energy sector stakeholders evaluate the performance and reliability of AI technologies.\\n\\nLearn more about the Open Power AI Consortium online and in EPRI’s sessions at GTC:\\n\\nTo learn more about advancements in AI across industries, watch the GTC keynote by NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang:\\n\\nSee notice regarding software product information.  \n",

Travel and holiday apartment rental concept.\\n\\nHostelworld has announced stronger earnings but “lower than expected’ revenue as European travellers sought out cheaper destinations in Asia and South America last year.\\n\\nThe Irish stock market listed company saw a 1pc decrease in net revenue, to €92m. However, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased 19pc, to €21.8m, compared to the previous year.\\n\\nThe online travel platform which has developed a complementary social network for backpackers and younger travellers announced its results for 2024 on Thursday.\\n\\nCEO Gary Morrison said that cost control and reduced marketing expenses helped the company last year.\\n\\n“In a year marked by lower-than-expected revenue growth, driven by our customers preference for lower-cost destinations, our social strategy continued to reduce marketing expenses driving net margin growth of 7pc year-over-year,” he said.\\n\\n“Combined with disciplined cost control, this resulted in a 19pc increase in adjusted EBITDA.”\\n\\nCustomers’ shift to cheaper destinations meant Hostelworld saw revenues dip even though bookings rose 6pc – to 6.9 million transactions.\\n\\nMr Morrison said: “Encouraging trends have continued into the first quarter of 2025 supported by bed price inflation in Asia.\"\\n\\n“I am also proud to report that we continue to advance our environmental, social and governance (ESG) agenda by taking responsibility for our carbon emissions and making a climate investment to offset their impact.”\\n\\nGoodbody analyst Dudley Shanley said that it was a strong year for the company.\\n\\nHe said, “We view it as a very strong year for Hostelworld Group. Despite the significant shift in 2024, the group continued to deliver against our expectations for strong earnings growth.”\\n\\n\"In terms of the growth agenda, we are hoping that the group will provide an insight into the power of the network it has built, the impact of AI on the business and the addressable market over the medium term.”\\n\\nSet up in 1999 in Ireland, Hostelworld has over 230 employees in 180 countries. Its core business is a booking platform for hostels and other accommodation favoured by back packers and independent travellers and it uses that user data to connect travellers based on their interests and location.\\n\\nLast year, two million new customers joined its social platform – and members accounted for 80pc of the bookings on the website.\\n\\nMr Morrison said, “Looking ahead, we are confident that our social strategy will continue to be a key differentiator in the online travel market.”\\n\\n\"We will continue to invest in our technology and expand our social features to enhance the customer experience and drive future growth.”\\n\\nHostelworld will announce a detailed growth strategy on April 29.  \n",

                                The spotlight has been on HP this week, with the vendor using its Amplify event to unveil a number of partner programme enhancements.\\n\\nTop of the list was the improved compensation available through SuperPower Booster, and there were also indications that the firm was stepping up its artificial intelligence (AI) enablement support.\\n\\nNeil MacDonald, HP UK and Ireland channel director, answered questions about what the announcements mean for partners.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do you expect the reaction and benefits to SuperPower Booster will be from and for UK partners?\\n\\nMacDonald: HP’s new Amplify SuperPower Booster will have a significant impact for UK partners, providing a more rewarding and flexible compensation structure that encourages sales across the full HP portfolio. This expansion of the More for More initiative from 2023 will drive increased revenue opportunities, ensuring partners benefit from higher compensation as they deliver a broader range of HP solutions to customers.\\n\\nAnother key benefit of the SuperPower Booster is to strengthen connection to a “One HP” approach. This enables partners to seamlessly integrate and sell products across HP’s entire portfolio. This holistic approach helps partners maximise value for customers while driving business growth across multiple categories.\\n\\nWe anticipate that partners will welcome this enhanced earning potential and the greater financial incentives, particularly at a time when businesses are looking to optimise profitability.\\n\\nIt’s clear AI is a crucial area for HP. Have partners been looking for more enablement in this area?\\n\\nAbsolutely. The demand for AI-driven solutions has skyrocketed, and partners are eager for the right tools, training and resources to help customers navigate this shift. That’s why HP has expanded the Amplify AI programme, offering partners new AI pathways, training modules and instant access to AI experts.\\n\\nWith this in mind, we’ve introduced a short, executive-focused AI training track with real-world business use cases to help partners engage customers in AI conversations with confidence. As AI adoption continues to grow, HP is committed to ensuring our partners stay ahead of the curve and drive business outcomes through AI innovation.\\n\\nThe Partner Portal is going to be transformed. How important is that to partners?\\n\\nHP’s Partner Portal transformation is a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to enhance partner efficiency and experience. We know that partners need seamless digital interactions, faster access to resources and streamlined business processes. That’s why we’re rolling out a two-year roadmap to make the HP Partner Portal a cutting-edge, AI-powered platform.\\n\\nA key highlight is the upcoming Partner AI Assistant, which will deliver personalised support, simplify onboarding and provide real-time assistance, enabling partners to work smarter and faster. This transformation underscores our commitment to digitally empowering partners with the right tools to grow their business and serve customers more effectively.\\n\\nSustainability continues to be a key issue for HP, but does it still resonate with partners and customers concerned about costs?\\n\\nSustainability remains a top priority for partners and customers, and it’s not just about compliance – it’s a business advantage. The success of HP Amplify Impact proves this, with participating partners seeing a 70% increase in win rates and a twofold rise in sustainable sales.\\n\\nWhile cost remains a key concern in today’s market, sustainability is increasingly a differentiator that drives customer decisions, particularly with growing legislative pressures and ESG expectations.\\n\\nHP is actively equipping partners with best-in-class sustainability assessments, resources and training to help them align with these evolving demands. We’ve moved beyond just helping partners develop sustainability plans – we’re now focused on helping them win business through sustainability, proving that environmental responsibility and commercial success go hand in hand.  \n",

      "24  Skeptical Science New Research for Week #12 2025\\n\\nPosted on 20 March 2025 by Doug Bostrom, Marc Kodack\\n\\nOpen access notables\\n\\nThe severe 2020 coral bleaching event in the tropical Atlantic linked to marine heatwaves, Rodrigues et al., Communications Earth & Environment:\\n\\nMarine heatwaves can amplify the vulnerabilities of regional marine ecosystems and jeopardise local economies and food resources. Here, we show that marine heatwaves in the tropical Atlantic have increased in frequency, intensity, duration, and spatial extent. Marine heatwaves are 5.1 times more frequent and 4.7 times more intense since the records started in 1982, with the 10 most extreme summers/falls in terms of marine heatwave cumulative intensity and spatial extension occurring in the last two decades. The extreme warming during the summer/fall of 2020 led to the largest bleaching event recorded along the Brazilian coast, with 85% of stony corals and 70% of zoanthids areas bleached in Rio do Fogo. The increase in the severity of the marine heatwaves in the western tropical Atlantic is not accompanied by trends in the strength of the local drivers. This suggests that weaker forcing can lead to more devastating marine heatwaves as the global ocean temperature rises due to climate change.\\n\\nArtificial structures can facilitate rapid coral recovery under climate change, Tanaya et al., Scientific Reports:\\n\\nRising seawater temperatures from climate change have caused coral bleaching, risking coral extinction by century’s end. To save corals, reef restoration must occur alongside other climate-change mitigation. Here we show the effectiveness of habitat creation on artificial structures for rapid coral restoration in response to climate change. We use 29 years of field observations for coral distributions on breakwaters and surrounding reefs (around 33,000 measurements in total). Following bleaching in 1998, breakwaters had higher coral cover (mainly Acropora spp.) than did surrounding natural reefs. Coral recovery times on breakwaters matched the frequency of recent bleaching events (~ every 6 years) and were accelerated by surface processing of the artificial structures with grooves. Corals on breakwaters were more abundant in shallow waters, under high light, and on moderately sloped substrate. Coral abundance on breakwaters was increased by incorporating shallow areas and surface texture. Our results suggest that habitat creation on artificial structures can increase coral community resilience against climate change by increasing coral recovery potential.\\n\\nA new hope or phantom menace? Exploring climate emotions and public support for climate interventions across 30 countries, Baum et al., Risk Analysis:\\n\\nThis article employed a unique, global dataset with 30,284 participants across 30 countries (in 19 languages) to provide insights on 3 questions. We first leveraged the global dataset to map the incidence of fear, hope, anger, sadness, and worry across countries—the first time the climate emotions of adults are investigated on this scale. We also identified significant differences in emotions by level of development, with those in advanced economies reporting weaker levels of climate emotions. Second, using multiple linear regression analyses, we explored the relationship between climate emotions and support for climate-intervention technologies. We determined that the emotions of hope and worry seem to be the most consistently (positively) correlated. Third, we explored if reading about technology categories differentially affected climate emotions. Individuals randomly assigned to read about ecosystems-based CDR [carbon dioxide removal] were significantly more hopeful about climate change (those about SRM [solar radiation management] the least).\\n\\nThreshold uncertainty, early warning signals and the prevention of dangerous climate change, Hurlstone et al., Royal Society Open Science:\\n\\nThe goal of the Paris Agreement is to keep global temperature rise well below 2°C. In this agreement—and its antecedents negotiated in Copenhagen and Cancun—the fear of crossing a dangerous climate threshold is supposed to serve as the catalyst for cooperation among countries. However, there are deep uncertainties about the location of the threshold for dangerous climate change, and recent evidence indicates this threshold uncertainty is a major impediment to collective action. Early warning signals of approaching climate thresholds are a potential remedy to this threshold uncertainty problem, and initial experimental evidence suggests such early detection systems may improve the prospects of cooperation. Here, we provide a direct experimental assessment of this early warning signal hypothesis. Using a catastrophe avoidance game, we show that large initial—and subsequently unreduced—threshold uncertainty undermines cooperation, consistent with earlier studies. An early warning signal that reduced uncertainty to within 10% (but not 30%) of the threshold value catalysed cooperation and reduced the probability of catastrophe occurring, albeit not reliably so. Our findings suggest early warning signals can trigger action to avoid a dangerous threshold, but additional mechanisms may be required to foster the cooperation needed to ensure the threshold is not breached.\\n\\nEarly warning of complex climate risk with integrated artificial intelligence, Reichstein et al., Nature Communications:\\n\\nAs climate change accelerates, human societies face growing exposure to disasters and stress, highlighting the urgent need for effective early warning systems (EWS). These systems monitor, assess, and communicate risks to support resilience and sustainable development, but challenges remain in hazard forecasting, risk communication, and decision-making. This perspective explores the transformative potential of integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) modeling. We highlight the role of AI in developing multi-hazard EWSs that integrate Meteorological and Geospatial foundation models (FMs) for impact prediction. A user-centric approach with intuitive interfaces and community feedback is emphasized to improve crisis management. To address climate risk complexity, we advocate for causal AI models to avoid spurious predictions and stress the need for responsible AI practices. We highlight the FATES (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics, and Sustainability) principles as essential for equitable and trustworthy AI-based Early Warning Systems for all. We further advocate for decadal EWSs, leveraging climate ensembles and generative methods to enable long-term, spatially resolved forecasts for proactive climate adaptation.\\n\\nFrom this week's government/NGO section:\\n\\nState of the Global Climate 2024, Kennedy et al., World Meteorological Organization\\n\\nThe publication provides a summary of the state of the climate indicators in 2024 with sections on key climate indicators, extreme events, and impacts. The indicators include global temperatures, greenhouse gas concentration, ocean heat content, sea level rise, ocean acidification, Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, glaciers, and precipitation, with an analysis of major drivers of inter-annual climate variability during the year including the El Niño Southern Oscillation and other ocean and atmospheric indices. The highlighted extreme events include those related to tropical cyclones and wind storms; flooding, drought, and extreme heat and cold events. The publication also provides the most recent findings on climate-related risks and impacts including on food security and population displacement.\\n\\nMeeting the Climate Emergency: University Information Infrastructure for Researching Wicked Problems, Donald Waters, Coalition for Networked Information\\n\\nThe author examines the role of research universities in addressing complex societal challenges. He focuses on climate change, which is best characterized as a “wicked” problem. Such problems are difficult to define and lack clear solutions in part because they involve multiple stakeholders who sometimes have sharply differing interests and perspectives. Given this complexity, understanding climate change is not just a matter for researchers in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and medicine. It requires an all-hands-on-deck approach across the disciplinary spectrum, including experts from the social sciences and humanities. It also requires deep engagement of researchers with the public. The author underscores the urgency and complexity of climate change and other wicked problems that impede human flourishing and offers concrete steps by which universities could adapt their research infrastructure to address these problems more effectively.\\n\\n107 articles in 51 journals by 664 contributing authors\\n\\nPhysical science of climate change, effects\\n\\nAmplified wintertime Arctic warming causes Eurasian cooling via nonlinear feedback of suppressed synoptic eddy activities, Yin et al., Science Advances 10.1126/sciadv.adr6336\\n\\nFire, Fuel, and Climate Interactions in Temperate Climates, Kampf et al., AGU Advances Open Access 10.1029/2024av001628\\n\\nMonitoring, modeling, and forecasting long-term changes in coastal seawater quality due to climate change, Guan et al., Nature Communications Open Access 10.1038/s41467-025-57913-4\\n\\nReconciling the Discrepancy in Projected Global Dryland Expansion in a Warming World, Zhou & Yu, Global Change Biology Open Access 10.1111/gcb.70102\\n\\nSatellite Retrievals Show Adiabatic Fraction of Marine Low Clouds Decreasing With Increasing Temperature and Height Above Cloud Base, Lu et al., Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Open Access 10.1029/2024jd043178\\n\\nTeleconnection from Arctic warming suppresses long-term warming in central Eurasia, Gong et al., Science Advances 10.1126/sciadv.adq9461\\n\\nObservations of climate change, effects\\n\\n40-Year Statistics of Warm-Season Extreme Hourly Precipitation over North China, Pei et al., Weather and Climate Extremes Open Access 10.1016/j.wace.2025.100761\\n\\nAnnual Cycle Changes in the Vertical Structure of Ocean Temperature: A Fingerprint of Human Influence on Climate, Shi et al., Journal of Climate 10.1175/jcli-d-24-0418.1\\n\\nApplication of XGBoost in Disentangling the Fingerprints of Global Warming and Decadal Climate Modes on Seasonal Precipitation Trends in Ohio, Wegener & Ibebuchi, International Journal of Climatology Open Access 10.1002/joc.8829\\n\\nPhysical and biogeochemical responses of Tibetan Plateau lakes to climate change, Zhu et al., Nature Reviews Earth & Environment 10.1038/s43017-025-00650-5\\n\\nTrends and Drivers of Tropical Cyclones Originating in the South China Sea during 1949-2021, Li et al., Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans 10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2025.101546\\n\\nInstrumentation & observational methods of climate change, effects\\n\\nDisagreement in Detected Heatwave Trends Resulting From Diagnostic Methods, Zhang et al., Geophysical Research Letters Open Access 10.1029/2024gl114398\\n\\nEarly warning of complex climate risk with integrated artificial intelligence, Reichstein et al., Nature Communications Open Access 10.1038/s41467-025-57640-w\\n\\nExtreme Event Attribution in the Mediterranean, Jézéquel et al., International Journal of Climatology Open Access 10.1002/joc.8799\\n\\nMexico's High Resolution Climate Database (MexHiResClimDB): a new daily high-resolution gridded climate dataset for Mexico covering 1951–2020, Carrera-Hernández, Open Access 10.5194/essd-2025-100\\n\\nThreshold uncertainty, early warning signals and the prevention of dangerous climate change, Hurlstone et al., Royal Society Open Science Open Access 10.1098/rsos.240425\\n\\nModeling, simulation & projection of climate change, effects\\n\\nConstrained Projections of Extreme Low Temperatures in Eastern China, Wang et al., Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres 10.1029/2024jd042741\\n\\nDevelopment of a high-resolution dataset of future monthly surface solar radiation by combining CMIP6 projections and satellite-based retrievals, HE et al., Advances in Climate Change Research Open Access 10.1016/j.accre.2025.02.007\\n\\nHigh-Resolution Climate Change Projections of Atmospheric Rivers Over the South Pacific, Goddard et al., Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Open Access 10.1029/2024jd041572\\n\\nAdvancement of climate & climate effects modeling, simulation & projection\\n\\nAn improved and extended parameterization of the CO2 15 µm cooling in the middle and upper atmosphere (CO2&cool&fort-1.0), López-Puertas et al., Geoscientific Model Development Open Access 10.5194/gmd-17-4401-2024\\n\\nEvaluation of the CMIP6 models for simulating the trend of the Barents-Kara Sea compound heatwaves in boreal autumn, Xin et al., Atmospheric Research 10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108077\\n\\nToo cold, too saturated?

There were close to 15,600 clean energy workers in the state of Maine in 2023, representing 2.4 percent of the entire state’s workforce. Between 2022 and 2023, the clean energy economy added more than 500 jobs, and by the end of 2023, it represented 3.2 percent of Maine’s total economic output, up from 2.7 percent in 2022. Not only is the clean energy economy growing, but it is outpacing Maine’s overall economy; while employment in the overall economy grew by 1.7 percent from 2022 to 2023, the clean energy workforce grew by 3.6 percent. Within New England, Maine’s clean energy workforce has grown the fastest since 2019\\n\\nGetting Transportation Right, Henningson et al., Natural Resources Defense Council\\n\\nThe scorecard assesses state policies and implementation related to eliminating transportation greenhouse gas pollution and improving access to clean transportation by ranking all 50 states and Washington, D.C., across 21 policy and outcome metrics. These metrics have been updated since 2023 to reflect feedback from in-state stakeholders and the availability of new data and research. The updates include raising the bar on how states earn points for existing metrics. This assessment identifies leading states and best practices, highlighting opportunities for elected and appointed leaders in every state to go further and faster to equitably deliver climate and public health benefits to their constituents.\\n\\nLanding the Economic Case for Climate Action with Decision Makers, Benayad et al., Boston Consulting Group and the University of Cambridge climaTRACES Lab\\n\\nGovernments, businesses, and people worldwide are paying the price for the storms, floods, heat waves, and droughts that are caused by climate change. Without the investment necessary to limit further global warming, the economic growth and resilience on which the world relies will be severely diminished along with societies’ ability to achieve their broader goals. The authors set out the economic case for climate action—and how we can make it influence today's decisions.\\n\\nCarbon Markets and Offset Guidance, Second Nature\\n\\nThe authors synthesize almost two years' worth of research into carbon markets, corporate offset engagement, and higher education offset engagement trends to provide an analysis of the options, risks, and best practices available to higher education. This comprehensive resource is designed to help colleges and universities navigate the evolving landscape of carbon offset markets with integrity. This updated guidance builds upon previous versions, integrating the latest scientific insights and best practices to support institutions committed to climate action\\n\\nWater and climate. Rising risks for urban populations, Michaelides et al., WaterAid\\n\\nThe authors examine climatic trends over the past 42 years in the world’s 100 most-populated cities, plus 12 cities where WaterAid works. They analyze whether these cities are becoming more prone to floods or droughts, and how these changes affect the people who live there. Many cities experience “whiplash”; droughts that dry up water sources followed closely by floods that overwhelm infrastructure, destroying sanitation systems and contaminating drinking water. Meanwhile, other cities are seeing dramatic climate reversals. Places accustomed to heavy rainfall are now facing droughts, while historically arid regions now grapple with unexpected floods.?\\n\\nUS Solar Market Insight, Martinez et al., Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association\\n\\nEach quarter, the authors collect granular data on the U.S. solar market from nearly 200 utilities, state agencies, installers, and manufacturers. These data provide the backbone of the report in which the authors identify and analyze trends in U.S. solar demand, manufacturing and pricing by state and market segment over the next five to ten years. The report includes all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.\\n\\nUS Electricity 2025 Special Report, Jones et al., Ember\\n\\nThe authors analyze full-year U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) electricity data to give an up-to-date view of the U.S. electricity system and key developments in 2024. Highlights include wind and solar combined producing a record 17% of U.S. electricity in 2024, overtaking coal at 15% for the first time; 3%=the year-on-year increase in electricity demand – the fifth largest year-on-year increase this century; and 64TWh=the year-on-year increase in solar generation, larger than the 59 TWh rise in gas generation.\\n\\nMeeting the Climate Emergency: University Information Infrastructure for Researching Wicked Problems, Donald Waters, Coalition for Networked Information\\n\\nThe author examines the role of research universities in addressing complex societal challenges. He focuses on climate change, which is best characterized as a “wicked” problem. Such problems are difficult to define and lack clear solutions in part because they involve multiple stakeholders who sometimes have sharply differing interests and perspectives. Given this complexity, understanding climate change is not just a matter for researchers in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and medicine. It requires an all-hands-on-deck approach across the disciplinary spectrum, including experts from the social sciences and humanities. It also requires deep engagement of researchers with the public. The author underscores the urgency and complexity of climate change and other wicked problems that impede human flourishing and offers concrete steps by which universities could adapt their research infrastructure to address these problems more effectively.\\n\\nHeat Stress in the Cambodian Workplace, Parsons et al, Royal Holloway, University of London\\n\\nThe risk of heatwaves is increasing in Cambodia. In early May 2024, Cambodia faced its highest average temperatures in 170 years. Heatwaves of this sort are now over four times more frequent than historical averages, posing a major risk to health. However, the health risk resulting from heatwaves is uneven. Relatively socially disadvantaged people are disproportionately affected by temperature extremes. This is a key policy priority for Cambodia. However, these differences are difficult to measure and interpret. This study is one of the first to combine socio-economic data with scientific core temperature measurement.\\n\\nMilitary Installation Resilience Review Phase 2.0, Northern Virginia Regional Commission\\n\\nThe Military Installation Resilience Review (MIRR) is a collaborative effort to address issues that impact the resiliency of four counties and three military installations in Northern Virginia. The authors present 50 recommended guidelines aimed at aligning policies and processes of the community, military partners, and the Northern Virginia Regional Commission with an overall goal of achieving more consistent and effective outcomes in addressing resiliency gaps. The authors focus on a set of specific issues and opportunities related to regional coordination, resilient transportation planning, transit service to military installations, stormwater and floodplain management, and emergency management and communications interoperability.\\n\\nCalifornia Heat Pump Partnership Blueprint, The California Heat Pump Partnership\\n\\nHeat pump space and water heating equipment (collectively referred to here as “heat pumps”) are critical technologies to move California toward a healthier, more efficient building stock, powered by clean electricity. While heat pumps are gaining traction among consumers and contractors, accelerated adoption is necessary to fully realize these benefits and meet California’s ambitious climate goals. The authors outline near-term strategies to advance the state’s target of installing six million heat pumps by 2030.\\n\\nA Guide to Navigating Carbon Markets: Exploring the Potential for Eastern Africa, Ahonen et al, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit\\n\\nCarbon markets are paving the way for sustainable development and climate action across the globe. In Eastern Africa, they hold tremendous potential to not only meet climate goals but also drive low-carbon economic growth and attract crucial investment. The authors discuss how Eastern African countries can leverage carbon markets to finance climate action; navigate market structures and regulatory frameworks; and empower policymakers and project developers with actionable insights.\\n\\nState of the Global Climate 2024, Kennedy et al, World Meteorological Organization\\n\\nThe publication provides a summary of the state of the climate indicators in 2024 with sections on key climate indicators, extreme events, and impacts. The indicators include global temperatures, greenhouse gas concentration, ocean heat content, sea level rise, ocean acidification, Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, glaciers, and precipitation, with an analysis of major drivers of inter-annual climate variability during the year including the El Niño Southern Oscillation and other ocean and atmospheric indices. The highlighted extreme events include those related to tropical cyclones and wind storms; flooding, drought, and extreme heat and cold events. The publication also provides the most recent findings on climate-related risks and impacts including on food security and population displacement.\\n\\nObtaining articles without journal subscriptions\\n\\nWe know it's frustrating that many articles we cite here are not free to read. One-off paid access fees are generally astronomically priced, suitable for such as \"On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\" but not as a gamble on unknowns. With a median world income of US$ 9,373, for most of us US$ 42 is significant money to wager on an article's relevance and importance.\\n\\nHere's an excellent collection of tips and techniques for obtaining articles, legally.\\n\\nUnpaywall offers a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that automatically indicates when an article is freely accessible and provides immediate access without further trouble. Unpaywall is also unscammy, works well, is itself offered free to use. The organizers (a legitimate nonprofit) report about a 50% success rate\\n\\nThe weekly New Research catch is checked against the Unpaywall database with accessible items being flagged. Especially for just-published articles this mechansim may fail. If you're interested in an article title and it is not listed here as \"open access,\" be sure to check the link anyway.\\n\\nHow is New Research assembled?\\n\\nMost articles appearing here are found via RSS feeds from journal publishers, filtered by search terms to produce raw output for assessment of relevance.\\n\\nRelevant articles are then queried against the Unpaywall database, to identify open access articles and expose useful metadata for articles appearing in the database.\\n\\nThe objective of New Research isn't to cast a tinge on scientific results, to color readers' impressions. Hence candidate articles are assessed via two metrics only:\\n\\nWas an article deemed of sufficient merit by a team of journal editors and peer reviewers? The fact of journal RSS output assigns a \"yes\" to this automatically.\\n\\nIs an article relevant to the topic of anthropogenic climate change? Due to filter overlap with other publication topics of inquiry, of a typical week's 550 or so input articles about 1/4 of RSS output makes the cut.\\n\\nA few journals offer public access to \"preprint\" versions of articles for which the review process is not yet complete. For some key journals this all the mention we'll see in RSS feeds, so we include such items in New Research. These are flagged as \"preprint.\"\\n\\nThe section \"Informed opinion, nudges & major initiatives\" includes some items that are not scientific research per se but fall instead into the category of \"perspectives,\" observations of implications of research findings, areas needing attention, etc.\\n\\nSuggestions\\n\\nPlease let us know if you're aware of an article you think may be of interest for Skeptical Science research news, or if we've missed something that may be important. Send your input to Skeptical Science via our contact form.\\n\\nJournals covered\\n\\nA list of journals we cover may be found here. We welcome pointers to omissions, new journals etc.\\n\\nPrevious edition\\n\\nThe previous edition of Skeptical Science New Research may be found here.  \n",

                                                This is a guest post for the Computer Weekly Developer Network written by Ivo Patty, lead data engineer at digital transformation specialist organisation Qodea.\\n\\nPatty writes in full as follows…\\n\\nIvo currently works as a Data Engineer within Cloud Technology Solutions. He specialises in Google Cloud platform implementations of data products, helping Qodea customers modernise their infrastructure and get from data to insights.\\n\\nThe AI race has to date been defined by scale – the larger the parameter-set the better – with Large language models (LLMs) dominating. However, as AI maturity has evolved, there is a growing acceptance that while size does matter, bigger isn’t always better.\\n\\nAs businesses deepen their understanding around how different AI models can be applied, Small Language Models (SLM) – which can be used for more task-specific use cases – are gaining traction. And big tech are getting on board. From Google’s Gemma to Open AI’s o3 mini, the next AI battlefront will be in the development of SLMs.\\n\\nThe real breakthrough with SLMs, however, isn’t that they can replace LLMs; it’s that they complement them. The future of AI isn’t about choosing one over the other – it’s about multi-model AI strategies, where different models work together to create more efficient, scalable and cost-effective solutions.\\n\\nBigger isn’t always better LLMs have dominated the spotlight in recent years. Take models like Gemini and ChatGPT – everyone’s heard of them and everyone wants to use them. In just three years, a third of work experiences are expected to be powered by conversational AI, whilst 80% of companies will be fronted by digital consumers and virtual agents. LLMs excel at processing huge amounts of data, generating human-like content and providing intelligent responses to queries. From powering chatbots to assisting clinicians in reviewing medical literature, these models are transforming how we work, communicate and innovate. However, LLMs aren’t without their challenges. They’re resource-hungry, requiring significant computational power and energy. This can have a huge environmental impact. Training a large language model like GPT-3 for example, is estimated to use just under 1,300 megawatt hours of electricity; about as much power as consumed annually by 130 US homes. They also require rigorous data management to avoid the leaking of sensitive information. Then comes AI hallucinations – instances where a model generates convincing but entirely false conclusions. While some mistakes are harmless, others pose serious risks, from outputting misinformation that influences public discourse, to producing inaccurate medical insights that could lead to misdiagnoses.\\n\\nFast, but not flawless SLMs are the new contenders in AI. These models are fast gaining traction, with Gartner estimating at least 50% of enterprises have actively looked at an SLM for their use cases in the last six to twelve months. SLMs, often 10x-100x smaller than LLMs, are designed for specialised tasks that don’t require huge datasets. Their compact size and ultra-low latency make them ideal for AI on mobile, edge devices and real-time apps. SLMs can generate responses in milliseconds rather than seconds: making them crucial for applications like live customer support, real-time transactions, or interactive experiences. Thanks to their focus on specific data, SLMs can provide more accurate, context-specific answers, reducing the risk of misleading responses. And unlike LLMs that rely on public data, SLMs are easier to tailor for proprietary use: giving organisations control over the algorithm, training and data. For example, consider integrating a model on a PoS system. We do not need 80B parameters to process ‘double cheeseburger with extra bacon’. We can use a smaller size model and use it to generate simple responses and make simple decisions. This is not only faster for the user of our system but also cheaper and consumes a lot less power. However, SLMs have limitations. Their smaller size limits their ability to capture and retain complex patterns and context across large data sets. This constrained understanding means they may struggle with complicated or niche topics, leading to incoherent or inaccurate responses. Fine-tuning improves accuracy, but the process is complex and requires scarce expertise.\\n\\nThe multi-model future of AI SLMs are great at what they do. But there still exist use-cases where an SLM wouldn’t be able to keep up with the processing ability of an LLM. For example, in legal document analysis, an LLM can handle vast amounts of client data and complex language, providing nuanced insights, while an SLM might miss broader legal contexts. On the other hand, LLMs can be overkill for simpler tasks like routine system interactions, where an SLM thrives. Where does this leave us? The rise of SLMs doesn’t spell the end for LLMs. Both have their strengths. Instead, it presents an exciting opportunity for developers to make smarter choices, carefully selecting the right model for the right use case. As we move forward, multi-model AI strategies will become the norm – where smaller, specialised models work in tandem with larger, more powerful ones. Yet to make multi-model a reality, developers will need to consider how they build and manage a multi-model AI pipeline. For this, developers will need a robust infrastructure that supports high computational power, efficient data handling and seamless model deployment. A flexible machine learning platform – such as Google Vertex AI – that supports training, deployment and orchestration of models of all sizes will be essential.  \n",

Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\\n\\nCNN —\\n\\nThe future of Ukraine. A looming trade war. Stock market turmoil. Rising prices for consumers in the midst of thousands of layoffs, with more to come. Whether your politics make you anxious or exhilarated by the events of the day, there’s no doubt that change and uncertainty breed stress.\\n\\nStress, of course, can disrupt sleep. For some, that stress can lead to insomnia, an inability to fall or stay asleep or waking up much earlier than desired. Chronic insomnia may lead to serious health issues, including heart attacks and stroke.\\n\\n“Everyone has a specific threshold for insomnia, and sometimes precipitating factors can break through the threshold and you can’t sleep. The stressors could be personal, professional, environmental, even political,” said sleep researcher Dr. Ana Krieger, a professor of clinical medicine in the departments of medicine, neurology and genetic medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.\\n\\nCases of insomnia have tended to rise during previous political and societal upheaval, said Michelle Drerup, a psychologist in the sleep disorders clinic of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\\n\\n“We’ve seen this throughout the past several decades,” Drerup said. “Oftentimes it’s people who are vulnerable or people who already have occasional difficulties, and this tips them over the edge.”\\n\\nHow to know if your sleep is at risk\\n\\nif you suffer from insomnia, don't toss and turn in bed. Get up and do something relaxing in low light, experts suggest. janiecbros/E+/Getty Images\\n\\nGood sleepers may be more immune to the effects of stress on their nighttime slumber, Krieger said. However, for people who have trouble drifting off or for those with sleep fragmentation — brief but frequent awakenings during the night — ongoing stress from the news can turn the occasional bad night of sleep into a real problem.\\n\\nAge is also a risk factor — older adults may already have issues with sleep due to existing health conditions, medications and chronic pain, and so may be especially sensitive to additional stress. Women also have higher rates of insomnia than men, as do people with family members who have insomnia, Drerup said.\\n\\n“There’s a genetic predisposition, but there’s also a behavioral impact,” she added. “If I am in an environment where my parents are up late, that will potentially impact my sleep schedule. Family history of mental health issues, specifically anxiety, is another predisposing factor.”\\n\\nDon’t turn to the dark side of insomnia\\n\\nHaving an occasional bout of insomnia is common, said sleep specialist Jennifer Mundt, an associate clinical professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah who sees patients at the school’s Sleep Wake Center.\\n\\n“Insomnia is a normal reaction to change in stress, even a good change,” Mundt said. “You might get married, get a new job, have a baby, but they still create stress and that can still disrupt your sleep. So it’s quite normal to have a temporary bout of insomnia, and then typically, sleep will go back to baseline.”\\n\\nHowever, some people develop unhelpful habits and ways of thinking about sleep that create a vicious cycle, said Krieger, who is also director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian.\\n\\n“Eventually, many people develop what are called perpetuating factors, or ways they try to cope, which often are not healthy or good for sleep and which can cause chronic insomnia,” she said. “We have patients who can’t sleep and start watching the news or read it on their phones. They turn on the lights, they eat. We even have some who play tennis or exercise in the middle of the night.”\\n\\nWhile experts encourage getting out of bed after 30 minutes of tossing and turning, it’s not wise to expose your eyes to the blue light of electronic devices during the middle of the night. Doing so just sends a message to the brain that turns off melatonin, the hormone that triggers sleepiness, Krieger said.\\n\\nEating during the night can lead to heartburn, indigestion and acid reflux, which can disrupt sleep. Exercising in the middle of the night raises body temperature, heart rate and stress hormones, which can derail attempts to doze off.\\n\\nOne of the worst behaviors a person with occasional insomnia can do is fret about it, said Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology in the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School.\\n\\n“However, I can sympathize with that behavior. I don’t know about you, but if I’m awake in the middle of the night, I think about how the world’s horrible, everything is bad, nobody likes me and I’m never going to go back to sleep again,” said Klerman, who is also a sleep researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital and sleep physician at Brigham and Young Women’s Hospital in Boston.\\n\\n“We owe it to people who are awake in the middle of the night to study what is happening, and provide more support for them,” she said.\\n\\nHow to stop insomnia from becoming chronic\\n\\nThere are tried and true techniques that can help you get your sleep back on track, experts say. First, stop doomscrolling.\\n\\n“I talk to a lot of my patients about setting a news curfew,” Mundt said. “Checking news and social media right up until bedtime won’t work. You need a buffer of an hour or so between keeping track of what’s going on and giving yourself time to unwind so you can sleep.”\\n\\nAvoid substances such as alcohol and drugs to wind down at the end of the day, as those can backfire, she said.\\n\\n“Those can just make your sleep worse,” Mundt said. “Avoid having too much caffeine during the day to try to compensate for not sleeping well — that can become a vicious cycle where you don’t sleep well, and then you have more caffeine, and then you don’t sleep well.”\\n\\nAnd remember, if you’re always thinking about how to get sleep, the harder it becomes to fall asleep, Mundt said.\\n\\n“When people start having insomnia, they can fixate on that, which then becomes a big source of anxiety,” she said. “It can become this really vicious cycle where the anxiety about sleep is the main thing feeding the sleep problem.\\n\\n“Remember, the perpetuating factors are really your behaviors and cognitions,” she said. “Those have the potential to keep the insomnia going even when the stress resolves. It’s these vicious cycles that we want to look out for.”\\n\\nFor those who need professional help, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, aptly named CBT-I, is widely considered the gold standard treatment, Mundt said. One key focus is on improving sleep schedules.\\n\\n“We have them track their sleep pattern with a log and then customize their sleep schedule to really regulate their sleep biology so that it gets more consolidated and more consistent,” she said.\\n\\nAnother focus of CBT-I is to retrain the brain to see the bed as a welcoming, calming place.\\n\\n“With insomnia, people spend a lot of time awake in bed. They’re frustrated and anxious, and that all becomes associated with the bed, turning it into this really negative place,” Mundt said.\\n\\n“This is where we talk about only going to bed if you’re sleepy and not using your bed for things other than sleep, and actually getting out of bed if you’re not sleeping for a while,” she said. “We’re trying to recondition and change those negative associations.”\\n\\nGet inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

Alberta, March 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- North American Construction Group Ltd. (\"NACG\") (TSX:NOA/NYSE:NOA) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024. Unless otherwise indicated, figures are expressed in Canadian dollars with comparisons to prior periods ended December 31, 2023.\\n\\nFourth Quarter 2024 Highlights:\\n\\nCombined revenue of $372.7 million, compared to $405.4 million in the same period last year. Reported revenue of $305.6 million, compared to $328.3 million in the same period last year, was generated by our wholly owned subsidiaries as incremental scopes and strong equipment utilization of 82% in Australia were more than offset by lower demand for our Canadian heavy equipment fleet when comparing to 2023 Q4.\\n\\nOur net share of revenue from equity consolidated joint ventures was $67.1 million in 2024 Q4 and compared to $77.1 million in the same period last year as the consistency in the Fargo and MNALP joint ventures were offset by lower scopes being completed within the Nuna Group of Companies.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA of $103.7 million and margin of 27.8% compared favorably to the prior period operating metrics of $101.1 million and 24.9%, respectively, as operational excellence in both Australia and Canada drove margin improvements.\\n\\nCombined gross profit for the quarter was $54.3 million and a margin of 14.6%. When adjusting for $10.1 million of integration costs incurred and $8.9 million of claims extinguished to secure long-term contracts, the resulting 19.7% reflects operational performance and compares favorably to 18.3% posted in the same period last year.\\n\\nCash flows generated from operating activities of $97.0 million were lower than the $168.6 million generated in the prior period as higher cash generation from the strong EBITDA was offset by the temporary impact of changes to working capital in the quarter.\\n\\nFree cash flow generated in the quarter was $50.5 million as operational earnings were offset by routine capital maintenance and cash interest expenses with working capital and capital work in process balances generating positive cash in the quarter.\\n\\nNet debt was $856.2 million at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $26.3 million from September 30, 2024, as free cash flow generation and the impact of a stronger CAD/AUD exchange rate were offset by growth spending, the NCIB program, and the dividend payment .\\n\\nAdditional highlights include: i) in November, we were awarded a $125 million heavy civil construction project primarily to construct diversion channels; ii) in December, we announced an extended and amended regional services contract, valued at $500 million, with a major producer in the oil sands region; iii) also in December, we were awarded a $100 million early works contract by a copper producer in the Australian state of New South Wales; iv) by the end of the year, we surpassed the 60% completion mark at the Fargo-Moorhead flood diversion project; and v) completed go-live activities for the ERP system in Australia during the quarter.\\n\\nJoe Lambert, President and CEO, stated, \"Once again, I would like to thank our operations team for their safe and efficient performance this quarter. The recent contract awards in Australia and Canada speak for themselves but are a testament to the quality and reputation of our operating teams. We're off to a fast and robust start this year, and we couldn't be more excited about completing the work our customers have awarded us. We see opportunities and tailwinds in the heavy civil infrastructure and mining industries in Australia and North America and are diligently advancing efforts to win scopes based on the reputation we have in the respective regions.\"\\n\\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\\n\\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue $ 305,590 $ 328,282 $ 1,165,787 $ 964,680 Cost of sales 218,834 220,672 789,056 678,528 Depreciation 44,765 41,990 166,683 131,319 Gross profit $ 41,991 $ 65,620 $ 210,048 $ 154,833 Gross profit margin 13.7 % 20.0 % 18.0 % 16.1 % General and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation)(i) 13,696 18,702 47,245 41,016 Stock-based compensation expense 5,625 (496 ) 8,706 15,828 Operating income 22,544 45,944 153,330 96,330 Interest expense, net 14,401 14,007 59,340 36,948 Net income 4,808 17,646 44,085 63,141 Adjusted EBITDA(i) 103,714 101,136 390,258 296,963 Adjusted EBITDA margin(i)(ii) 27.8 % 24.9 % 27.6 % 23.2 % Per share information Basic net income per share $ 0.18 $ 0.66 $ 1.65 $ 2.38 Diluted net income per share $ 0.19 $ 0.58 $ 1.52 $ 2.09 Adjusted EPS(i) $ 1.00 $ 0.87 $ 3.73 $ 2.83\\n\\n(i) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\\n\\n(ii)Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated using adjusted EBITDA over total combined revenue.\\n\\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities $ 96,989 $ 168,569 $ 217,607 $ 278,090 Cash used in investing activities (75,764 ) (137,756 ) (274,683 ) (244,879 ) Effect of exchange rate on changes in cash 1,400 (4,532 ) 353 (5,994 ) Add back of growth and non-cash items included in the above figures: Acquisition of MacKellar(i) — 51,671 — 51,671 Acquisition costs — 5,934 — 7,095 Buyout of BNA Remanufacturing LP 4,210 — 4,210 — Growth capital additions(ii) 23,646 35,941 84,633 40,416 Capital additions financed by leases(ii) — (931 ) (14,157 ) (28,159 ) Free cash flow(ii) $ 50,481 $ 118,896 $ 17,963 $ 98,240\\n\\n(i)Acquisition of MacKellar is the purchase price less cash acquired.\\n\\n(ii)See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\\n\\nResults for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2024\\n\\nRevenue from wholly-owned entities was $305.6 million, down from $328.3 million in the same period last year. The quarter-over-quarter reduction reflects a reduction in overall work scopes in the Heavy Equipment - Canada segment due to a reduction in equipment utilization to 54%, compared to 65% in 2023 Q4, largely offset by improved performance in the Heavy Equipment - Australia segment. Revenue generated in that segment of $160.3 million includes a strong contribution from MacKellar of $155.4 million, up from $122.5 million in Q4 of last year, as the group commences work on new contracts and increases equipment utilization at existing sites. Eliminations in the quarter largely relate to equipment maintenance performed by the Heavy Equipment - Canada segment on MacKellar equipment.\\n\\nGross profit was $42.0 million, representing 13.7% of revenue, compared to $65.6 million and a 20.0% gross margin in the same period last year. The decline was primarily driven by lower contributions from the Heavy Equipment - Canada segment. Cost of sales for the quarter totaled $218.8 million, down from $220.7 million in the prior-period, reflecting lower overall revenue levels. Gross profit in the Heavy Equipment - Canada segment was impacted by the $8.9 million customer claim extinguishment as part of a four-year $500 million contract extension executed in December 2024. Gross profit in the Heavy Equipment - Australia segment was impacted by $10.1 million of integration costs, primarily transportation of haul trucks from North America to Australia.\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation expense) were $13.7 million, or 4.5% of revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2024, down from $18.7 million, or 5.7% of revenue, in the same period last year. The current year decrease is due to the inclusion of non-recurring MacKellar acquisition costs totaling $5.9 million in the prior year, offset by spend related to increased activity levels in the Heavy Equipment - Australia segment.\\n\\nCash related interest expense of $13.7 million represents an average cost of debt of 6.7% (compared to $13.2 million and 8.8%, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2023). The increase in interest expense is primarily attributed to a higher balance on the Credit Facility, along with greater equipment financing—mainly from the addition of MacKellar—partially offset by the elimination of our customer supply chain financing arrangement late in Q3.\\n\\nNet income of $4.8 million in Q4 2024, compared to $17.6 million in the same period last year, was lower due to the lower gross profit factors discussed above, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses and improved results from the equity joint ventures.\\n\\nFree cash flow in the quarter was $50.5 million, driven primarily by adjusted EBITDA of $103.7 million less sustaining capital spending of $47.7 million and cash interest paid of $13.7 million.\\n\\nLiquidity\\n\\nIncluding equipment financing availability and factoring in the amended Credit Facility agreement, total available capital liquidity of $275.3 million includes total liquidity of $170.6 million, $86.7 million of unused finance lease borrowing availability, and $17.9 million of unused other borrowing availability as at December 31, 2024. Liquidity is primarily provided by the terms of our $522.6 million credit facility which allows for funds availability based on a trailing twelve-month EBITDA as defined in the agreement, and is now scheduled to expire in October 2027.\\n\\nBusiness Updates\\n\\nStrategic Focus Areas for 2025\\n\\nSafety - maintain our uncompromising commitment to health and safety while elevating the standard of excellence in the field, particularly with regards to front-line leadership training;\\n\\nOperational excellence - put into action practical and experienced-based protocols to ensure predictable high-quality project execution in Australia;\\n\\nExecution - enhance equipment availability in Canada through improved fleet maintenance, equipment telematics and reliability programs, technical improvements and management systems;\\n\\nIntegration - utilize recently implemented ERP at MacKellar Group to optimize business processes to lower overall costs and improve working capital management;\\n\\nOrganic growth - based on strong site operating performance, leverage customer satisfaction to earn contract extensions and expansions;\\n\\nDiversification - pursue diversification of customers and resources through strategic partnerships, industry expertise and investment in Indigenous joint ventures; and\\n\\nSustainability - further develop and deliver into our environmental, social and governance goals.\\n\\nOutlook for 2025\\n\\nThe following table provides projected key measures for 2025 and actual results of 2024 and 2023. The measures for 2025 are predicated on contracts currently in place, including expected renewals and the heavy equipment fleet that we own and operate.\\n\\nKey measures 2023 Actual 2024 Actual 2025 Outlook Combined revenue(i) $1.3B $1.4B $1.4 - $1.6B Adjusted EBITDA(i) $297M $390M $415 - $445M Sustaining capital(i) $169M $166M $180 - $200M Adjusted EPS(i) $2.83 $3.73 $3.70 - $4.00 Free cash flow(i) $90M $18M $130 - $150M Capital allocation Growth spending(i) $40M $85M $65 - $75M Net debt leverage(i) 1.7x 2.2x Targeting 1.7x\\n\\n(i)See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\\n\\nConference Call and Webcast\\n\\nManagement will hold a conference call and webcast to discuss our financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, tomorrow, Thursday, March 20, 2025, at 9:00 am Eastern Time (7:00 am Mountain Time).\\n\\nThe call can be accessed by dialing:\\n\\nToll free: 1-800-717-1738\\n\\nConference ID: 71653\\n\\nA replay will be available through April 20, 2025, by dialing:\\n\\nToll Free: 1-888-660-6264\\n\\nConference ID: 71653\\n\\nPlayback Passcode: 71653\\n\\nA slide deck for the webcast will be available for download the evening prior to the call and will be found on the company’s website at www.nacg.ca/presentations/\\n\\nThe live presentation and webcast can be accessed at:\\n\\nhttps://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=70DEA77D-C2B3-4C4B-80EF-A1303C5C95BF\\n\\nA replay will be available until April 20, 2025, using the link provided.\\n\\nBasis of Presentation\\n\\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"US GAAP\"). Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts discussed are in Canadian dollars. Please see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, for further detail on the matters discussed in this release. In addition to the MD&A, please reference the dedicated 2024 Q4 Results Presentation for more information on our results and projections which can be found on our website under Investors - Presentations.\\n\\nChange in significant accounting policy - Basis of presentation\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we changed our accounting policy for the elimination of its proportionate share of profit from downstream sales to affiliates and joint ventures to record through equity earnings in affiliates and joint ventures on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Prior to this change, we eliminated our proportionate share of profit on downstream sales to affiliates and joint ventures through revenue and cost of sales. The change in accounting policy simplifies the presentation for downstream profit eliminations and has no cumulative impact on retained earnings. We have accounted for the change retrospectively in accordance with the requirements of US GAAP Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 250 by restating the comparative period. For details of retrospective changes, refer to note 25 in the consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nAccounting pronouncements recently adopted\\n\\nSegment reporting\\n\\nThe Company adopted the new standard for segment reporting that is effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024.

A non-GAAP financial measure is defined by relevant regulatory authorities as a numerical measure of an issuer's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flow that is not specified, defined or determined under the issuer’s GAAP and that is not presented in an issuer’s financial statements. A \"non-GAAP ratio\" is a ratio, fraction, percentage or similar expression that has a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios do not have standardized meanings under GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A \"supplementary financial measure\" is a financial measure disclosed, or intended to be disclosed, on a periodic basis to depict historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that does not fall within the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure or non-GAAP ratio. The non-GAAP financial measures and ratios we present include, \"adjusted EBIT\", \"adjusted EBITDA\", \"adjusted EBITDA margin\" \"adjusted EPS\", \"adjusted net earnings\", \"backlog\", \"capital additions\", \"capital expenditures, net\", \"capital inventory\", \"capital work in progress\", \"cash liquidity\", \"cash related interest expense\", \"cash provided by operating activities prior to change in working capital\", \"combined backlog\", \"combined gross profit\", \"combined gross profit margin\", \"equity investment depreciation and amortization\", \"equity investment EBIT\", \"equity method investment backlog\", \"free cash flow\", \"general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation)\", \"growth capital\", \"growth spending\", \"invested capital\", \"margin\", \"net debt\", \"net debt leverage\", \"share of affiliate and joint venture capital additions\", \"sustaining capital\", \"total capital liquidity\", \"total combined revenue\", and \"total debt\". We also use supplementary financial measures such as \"gross profit margin\" and \"total net working capital (excluding cash and current portion of long-term debt)\" in our MD&A.

Agency’s Euclid telescope has just magnified our view of the universe with the release of its first wave of survey data, capturing hundreds of thousands of galaxies in remarkable detail. The latest update shares a preview of three deep fields, areas chock-full of galaxies that Euclid will inspect as part of its mission to map one-third of the entire sky.\\n\\nWith one scan of each deep field, Euclid has been able to spot 26 million galaxies, the farthest of which lie 10.5 billion light-years away. To classify this deluge of cosmic data, the ESA has called upon citizen scientists to help classify the galaxies with some assistance from AI algorithms. More than 380,000 galaxies have been classified so far, but this amount is just one drop of a colossal data pool that will bring images of 1.5 billion galaxies to light over the next few years.\\n\\nEuclid Telescope Explores Deep Fields\\n\\nThe Euclid telescope, launched in 2023, is equipped to create the largest 3D map of the universe to date by observing optical and near-infrared light. Over the course of its six-year mission, it will explore the sky in two ways: a wide survey, which will span 14,000 square degrees of the sky, and a deep survey, which will take a closer look at three smaller patches that altogether make up 63 square degrees of the sky.\\n\\nThese deep fields that Euclid will concentrate on — called Deep Field South, Deep Field Fornax, and Deep Field North — could help scientists unravel mysteries of the universe hidden in the complex organization of galaxies. The images are expected to deliver new perspectives on dark matter and dark energy, concepts that are thought to facilitate the evolution of galaxies and account for 95 percent of the universe.\\n\\nRead More: Light From a Distant Galaxy Encircles a Nearer One, Called an Einstein Ring\\n\\nA Team Effort\\n\\nThe sheer amount of data collected by Euclid — including the 380,000 classified galaxies — required input from volunteers through the Galaxy Zoo program. This endeavor encouraged the public to participate by determining the shape of the galaxies observed by Euclid, distinguished by telltale features like spiral arms and tidal tails.\\n\\nThe recently released catalog, however, only represents a mere 0.4 percent of the total number of galaxies that Euclid will observe during its mission. And the stream of data continues to flow without slowing down, with 100 GB of data from Euclid being sent back to Earth every day.\\n\\nThe Invisible Impact of Dark Matter\\n\\nIn addition to spotting galaxies, Euclid will be able to perceive how dark matter interacts with them. The telescope can measure an effect called gravitational lensing, which occurs when both normal matter and dark matter warp the space around galaxies and cause light to bend as it travels. By measuring this effect, scientists can begin to infer how invisible dark matter is affecting galaxies through its gravitational influence.\\n\\nWith the latest survey data, Euclid has provided 500 gravitational lens candidates, depicted as distortions of light that take on varying shapes. By the end of the mission, it will have identified 100,000 instances of this effect.\\n\\nIn February 2025, Euclid came across an Einstein Ring, a rare phenomenon caused by gravitational lensing. In a surprise siting around 590 million light-years from Earth, light from a background galaxy curved around a foreground galaxy (NGC 6505) and created a brilliant ring.\\n\\nEuclid's mission will carry on until 2030, but it has already made significant strides in revealing the scope of the sky. With maps of the three deep fields starting to expand, answers to dark matter and dark energy may soon be in reach.\\n\\nRead More: Light From a Distant Galaxy Encircles a Nearer One, Called an Einstein Ring\\n\\nArticle Sources\\n\\nOur writers at Discovermagazine.com use peer-reviewed studies and high-quality sources for our articles, and our editors review for scientific accuracy and editorial standards.

released its 2024 progress report for the Yale Sustainability Plan 2025, highlighting significant advances made in the past year toward making the university more sustainable for those who study, live, and work here.\\n\\nLaunched in 2016, the strategic plan has served as a comprehensive roadmap for the university’s pursuit of environmental, social, and economic sustainability during a decade when the consequences of climate change have become starker.\\n\\nAs of 2024, Yale has achieved 23 of the goals outlined in the plan resulting in wide-ranging impacts—from how the university conserves energy to how food is sourced for dining halls, how goods and services are purchased, how materials are diverted from the waste stream, and how to promote the well-being of the campus community.\\n\\n“Our progress showcases the incredible dedication and collaborative spirit within our community. Each step forward in our sustainability efforts is a collective achievement,” said Amber Garrard, Director of the Office of Sustainability. “We celebrate the advances made in 2024 and look ahead with optimism toward Yale’s continuing climate and sustainability goals.”\\n\\nKey Sustainability Accomplishments in 2024\\n\\nYale’s sustainability efforts in 2024 reflect the university’s commitments to driving operational excellence while actively engaging with university and New Haven communities.\\n\\nHighlights from the past year include:\\n\\nEnergy & Emissions\\n\\nThe university maintained a 28% net decrease in its scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 levels, despite campus growing by 14%. Net emissions represent the university’s total scope 1 and 2 emissions minus carbon offsets that are purchased and retired.

This comprehensive process enabled in-house staff to help identify efficiency and operational issues with building ventilation systems; make repairs in a timely manner; and save 18,000 MMBTU of energy.\\n\\nIn 2017, Yale identified six categories of scope 3 emissions– emissions that occur because of Yale’s operations, but from sources not owned or controlled by the university – that are most relevant to the university. In 2024, we continued to refine pathways for mitigating our impact in these categories.\\n\\nCapital Program\\n\\nFive LEED Gold buildings came online in 2024. In total, 17 Yale building projects have earned LEED Gold certification since 2016.\\n\\nFive LEED Gold buildings came online in 2024. In total, 17 Yale building projects have earned LEED Gold certification since 2016. The reopened Yale Peabody Museum earned LEED Gold following a four-year renovation. The museum features an improved building envelope, state-of-the-art air-handling units, systems to capture and utilize rainwater in the landscape, bird-safe glass, and expanded galleries and classroom spaces.\\n\\nThe Living Village at Yale Divinity School, the university’s first Living Building project, is under construction and set to open in fall 2025. The project demonstrates the school’s commitment to housing future environmental leaders in a regenerative building that will give back to the environment more than it takes.\\n\\nMobility\\n\\nThe Yale Shuttle achieved a 23% increase in ridership following the introduction of new shuttle routes and an improved real-time shuttle tracker.\\n\\nThe Yale Shuttle achieved a 23% increase in ridership following the introduction of new shuttle routes and an improved real-time shuttle tracker. In 2019, Yale had five single-hose electric vehicle charging stations available for fleet vehicles and drivers parking on campus. Since then, 38 dual-hose units have been installed, for a total of 76 charging options. Thirteen of Yale’s fleet vehicles are now electric, including six EVs acquired in 2024. University policy requires that all new vehicle purchases be alternative fuel.\\n\\nWaste Reduction\\n\\nTo help improve campus waste diversion rates, the university redesigned and deployed new recycling and waste signs campuswide, updating 22,000 labels and 10,000 signs for food waste, single-stream recycling, and municipal solid waste. The redesign was supported by a university-wide campaign to raise visibility about best practices and common mistakes in waste-sorting.\\n\\nTo help improve campus waste diversion rates, the university redesigned and deployed new recycling and waste signs campuswide, updating 22,000 labels and 10,000 signs for food waste, single-stream recycling, and municipal solid waste. The redesign was supported by a university-wide campaign to raise visibility about best practices and common mistakes in waste-sorting. Spring Salvage—which collects and donates unwanted items during undergraduate student move-out in May—recovered 2% more material compared to the prior year.\\n\\nConstruction and demolition waste is a large waste steam for Yale and the university is committed to making an impact. Last year, Yale diverted 76% of its construction and demolition waste such as concrete, drywall, and bricks through recycling and reuse efforts.\\n\\nStewardship & Resilience\\n\\nIn 2024, a Stormwater Planning Study for Central Campus and Yale School of Medicine was completed, identifying critical areas for greater stormwater management. Additionally, planning is underway for stormwater mitigation projects at West Campus, and revised stormwater standards for the university are in development.\\n\\nThe university created a tree management plan for the Yale Golf Course and partnered with researchers and students to enhance biodiversity on the site and the surrounding nature preserve. A unique partnership between the Yale School of Environment, Yale Athletics, and Yale Facilities has enabled this project to serve as a living laboratory for hands-on research and enhanced operations.\\n\\nNew Haven Partnerships\\n\\nIn summer 2024, Yale placed nine student fellows in local organizations through the Yale Office of New Haven Affairs to enhance community greenspace and lead environmental education initiatives.\\n\\nIn summer 2024, Yale placed nine student fellows in local organizations through the Yale Office of New Haven Affairs to enhance community greenspace and lead environmental education initiatives. Through several Yale Planetary Solutions seed grants, the university advanced research projects that partner with New Haven community members and aim to develop scalable climate solutions to challenges such as urban air quality, environmental literacy, and more.\\n\\nLooking to the Future\\n\\nWhile celebrating the goals achieved, the university continues to pursue opportunities for improvement that will build on our progress and strengthen the culture of sustainability at Yale.\\n\\nCampus waste diversion remains low at 34%—below the pre-pandemic norm, when 40% of materials on campus were diverted from the waste stream, and well below the current target of 60%. Operational leaders continue working towards actions aimed at improving the university’s waste diversion while new signage and communications efforts aim to increase awareness and shift behavior.\\n\\nLikewise, the rapidly evolving use of data centers and AI has surfaced questions about how to reconcile the university’s energy use with programming demands—considerations that are being carefully weighed as Yale seeks to expand its technology use responsibly. In 2024, Yale became a member in the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center consortium, shifting computationally intensive research from less efficient campus infrastructure to a LEED platinum-certified green data center.\\n\\n“Many challenges remain ahead of us, and we will continue to work on setting goals and targets that keep us focused on the direction we need to be moving in, while aligning with our institutional mission and values,” said Garrard.\\n\\nYale’s sustainability work is being further advanced by Yale Planetary Solutions (YPS), a university-wide initiative spanning academics and operations—and synergies between the two. The mission of YPS is to advance planetary solutions through all that Yale is—from students and faculty to collections and campus buildings—and all that Yale does, from researching, to teaching, to operating, investing, convening and leading.\\n\\nThe Yale Planetary Solutions Steering Committee—composed of leaders from across the institution—described a framework for the university’s work in this critical space in a report released in June 2024. Throughout the coming year, Yale Planetary Solutions will lead a process to build the next evolution of the climate and sustainability vision for the university, developing goals in collaboration with schools and units across the campus, and structures to support institutional accountability that fuel our collective success.\\n\\n“It’s inspiring to see how our community can unite to advance sustainability on multiple fronts,” Garrard added. “Our collective efforts have led to significant strides in environmental stewardship, social equity, and resource management. Moving forward, we are dedicated to building on these accomplishments, fostering a culture that integrates sustainability into every aspect of university life and prepares us to meet the challenges of the future.”\\n\\nRead the full 2024 Yale Sustainability Progress Report.\\n\\nExplore our new story map, “16 ways Yale advanced campus sustainability in 2024.”\\n\\nRead the full Yale Planetary Solutions Steering Committee Report.  \n",

trillion in assets under management globally aligned with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. Investors, institutions, and regulators are demanding greater transparency in how businesses operate, leading to an increasing number of companies promoting their sustainability efforts.\\n\\nHowever, as interest in ESG investing has grown, so has the practice of greenwashing—when companies mislead stakeholders by exaggerating or fabricating their environmental or social responsibility claims. Greenwashing not only deceives investors but also undermines the entire movement toward sustainability.\\n\\nThis has led to an urgent need for data-driven ESG verification. Traditional methods of evaluating a company’s sustainability efforts, such as self-reported disclosures and third-party audits, are often inadequate. Companies can manipulate their public image by selectively reporting favorable information while obscuring negative impacts.\\n\\nTo address this challenge, AI-powered ESG intelligence is emerging as a critical tool for detecting greenwashing and ensuring that investors can distinguish between companies genuinely committed to sustainability and those merely capitalizing on the trend.\\n\\nGreenwashing manifests in several ways, making it difficult for investors to identify without deep analysis. Some of the most common forms include:\\n\\n1. Selective Disclosure\\n\\nCompanies highlight their most sustainable initiatives while omitting information about harmful practices. For example, a company may showcase its renewable energy investments while failing to disclose that a significant portion of its revenue still comes from fossil fuels.\\n\\n2. Vague or Misleading Language\\n\\nTerms such as green, eco-friendly, sustainable, and carbon-neutral are frequently used in corporate messaging without concrete evidence or third-party validation. These claims can create the illusion of sustainability without measurable impact.\\n\\n3. Lack of Verifiable Data\\n\\nSome organizations release sustainability reports that include ambitious targets without any clear roadmap or third-party verification. This makes it difficult to assess whether progress is being made.\\n\\n4. Third-Party Credibility Without Substance\\n\\nCompanies may partner with sustainability-focused organizations or receive ESG ratings that do not comprehensively assess their true environmental and social impact. This can create the false impression that they are meeting high sustainability standards.\\n\\n5. Contradictions Between Business Practices and Public Messaging\\n\\nSome companies advertise ESG commitments while engaging in contradictory actions. For instance, financial institutions that pledge to fund green energy projects while continuing to finance coal and oil companies at large scales.\\n\\nThe Role of AI in Detecting Greenwashing Risks\\n\\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming how investors and regulators detect and mitigate greenwashing risks. AI-driven ESG intelligence systems can analyze vast amounts of unstructured and structured data to uncover inconsistencies and ensure greater transparency.\\n\\n1. AI-Powered Text and Sentiment Analysis\\n\\nAI can process and analyze corporate sustainability reports, press releases, earnings call transcripts, and social media communications to identify inconsistencies in messaging and commitments. Natural language processing (NLP) can detect patterns of exaggerated claims or evasive language that indicate potential greenwashing.\\n\\nFor example, if a company frequently discusses its carbon neutrality goals but provides no concrete timeline or scope of emissions reductions, AI can flag this as a potential risk.\\n\\n2. Cross-Checking ESG Claims with Publicly Available Data\\n\\nCompanies often make sustainability claims without providing detailed verification. AI can compare these statements with third-party reports, regulatory filings, and environmental impact assessments to verify their accuracy.\\n\\nFor instance, if a corporation reports significant emissions reductions but public environmental databases show continued high carbon output, AI can highlight this discrepancy.\\n\\n3. Real-Time News and Social Media Monitoring\\n\\nAI-powered monitoring tools can track ESG-related news, legal proceedings, activist reports, and social media discussions to uncover emerging controversies and public sentiment about a company’s sustainability performance.\\n\\nIf a company claims to be eliminating waste in its supply chain but is found to be linked to environmental violations in overseas operations, AI can detect the contradiction in real time.\\n\\n4. Detecting Inconsistencies in ESG Ratings\\n\\nMany companies benefit from high ESG scores despite questionable environmental and social practices. AI can analyze multiple ESG rating sources and industry benchmarks to highlight discrepancies and potential biases in rating methodologies.\\n\\nFor example, a fast-fashion brand might receive a strong ESG rating from one agency based on supply chain labor policies, while another report uncovers ongoing worker exploitation and unsustainable materials usage. AI can surface these conflicting assessments, providing investors with a more complete picture.\\n\\n5. Regulatory Compliance and Reporting Standards Tracking\\n\\nAs ESG regulations evolve worldwide, companies are expected to align with stricter disclosure requirements such as:\\n\\nThe EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)\\n\\nThe Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\\n\\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) climate disclosure rules\\n\\nAI can ensure that companies’ sustainability disclosures are aligned with legal requirements and flag missing or non-compliant data. For instance, if a company claims compliance with EU taxonomy rules but omits required carbon footprint disclosures, AI can detect this omission.\\n\\nBy leveraging AI-driven ESG intelligence, investors can significantly improve their ability to:\\n\\nIdentify authentic sustainability leaders by analyzing real, verifiable ESG performance data.\\n\\nby analyzing real, verifiable ESG performance data. Avoid greenwashed investments that may pose long-term reputational and financial risks.\\n\\nthat may pose long-term reputational and financial risks. Ensure compliance with evolving ESG regulations and mitigate potential legal exposure.\\n\\nand mitigate potential legal exposure. Enhance portfolio resilience by investing in companies that demonstrate genuine and measurable commitments to sustainability.\\n\\nGreenwashing will continue to be a challenge as ESG investing grows, but AI is providing a powerful solution to enforce transparency, accountability, and trust in the sustainable investment ecosystem.\\n\\nThe future of sustainable investing depends on data integrity, transparency, and AI-driven verification. As more investors demand verifiable ESG impact, AI will play an essential role in uncovering hidden risks, preventing misleading claims, and fostering a culture of genuine corporate responsibility.\\n\\nFor businesses, the message is clear: greenwashing is no longer an option. Companies must back up their sustainability claims with real data, or they risk exposure from AI-powered analysis that will hold them accountable.\\n\\nFor investors, due diligence must go beyond marketing materials. By incorporating AI-driven ESG intelligence, they can separate true sustainability leaders from companies that merely pay lip service to ESG principles.\\n\\nAs AI technology continues to advance, the path to responsible, impact-driven investing will become clearer, ensuring that capital is directed towards businesses that drive real environmental and social change.  \n",

the era of autonomous machines. In this new age, service robots, autonomous drones, delivery robots, self-driving vehicles and other autonomous machines are poised to replace humans in providing various services.5 While the rise of autonomous machines promises to revolutionize our economy, the reality has fallen short of expectations despite over a decade of intensive R&D investments. The current development paradigm, dubbed Autonomy 1.0, scales mainly with the size of engineering team rather than with the amount of relevant data or computational resources. This limitation prevents the autonomy industry from fully leveraging economies of scale, particularly the exponentially decreasing cost of computing power and the explosion of available data. After evaluating the key scalability blockers, we argue that Autonomy 2.0, which is driven by an ever-evolving software stack that improves with more data and computational power, alongside a novel digital twin paradigm that enables algorithmic exploration through realistic, large-scale simulations prior to deployment, will address these challenges to significantly accelerate progress in the autonomy industry.\\n\\nScalability of the Digital Economy The digital economy, characterized by the use of information technology to create, market, distribute, and consume goods and services, has been the primary driver of global economic growth over the past two decades. The Internet industry, a key component of the digital economy, exemplifies this impact. From 2005 to 2010, it accounted for 21% of GDP growth in mature economies. In 2019, the Internet industry contributed $2.1 trillion to the U.S. economy—approximately 10% of its annual GDP—making it the fourth largest industry behind only real estate, government, and manufacturing. Moreover, the industry directly provides nearly six million jobs, representing 4% of U.S. employment. Technological scalability is the cornerstone fueling the continuous growth of the digital economy. The most successful companies in this sector have developed core technology stacks that scale with available computational resources and data, rather than with the size of their engineering teams. WhatsApp serves as a remarkable example: When Facebook acquired it for $19 billion, the company had only 32 engineers serving over 450 million users. In stark contrast, today’s autonomous machine technologies, dubbed Autonomy 1.0, embody practices that a scalable industry should avoid. We compare the R&D expenditures and revenue per employee of two leading public digital economy companies—Microsoft (representing the software industry) and Alphabet (representing the Internet industry)—against two public autonomous driving companies: TuSimple (representing the robot truck industry) and Aurora (representing the robotaxi industry). These autonomous driving companies were selected for the accessibility of their financial data. Both Alphabet and Microsoft demonstrate remarkable efficiency, allocating less than 20% of their total operating expenditures to R&D. Alphabet, in particular, serves over 4.3 billion users with fewer than 30,000 engineers. Their scalability is primarily constrained by available computational resources and data, rather than by their workforce size. In Comparison, TuSimple and Aurora allocate more than 70% of their operating expenditures to R&D. Autonomous driving companies often face the challenge of recalibrating their existing technology stacks to adapt to new environments when expanding their user base or deploying services to new regions. Consequently, their scalability is limited by R&D investment or, more directly, by the number of engineers they employ. This disparity in operational efficiency translates directly to financial performance. Alphabet and Microsoft generate $1.5 million and $0.8 million in revenue per employee respectively, while maintaining high growth rates. Conversely, TuSimple and Aurora generate negligible revenue per employee and struggle with growth. For the autonomy industry to achieve economies of scale comparable to the digital giants, a revolution in the R&D paradigm is imperative.\\n\\nAutonomy 1.0: An Aging Paradigm The accompanying figure illustrates the scalability challenges of Autonomy 1.0 using autonomous driving operation data from California between 2018 and 2022. Despite massive investments in autonomous driving over this five-year period, the growth in the operational vehicle fleet has been modest, increasing from just 400 vehicles in 2018 to 1,500 in 2022. Similarly, the annual operation mileage saw only a limited increase from two million miles to five million miles. Most critically, the industry continues to grapple with over 2,000 disengagement incidents per year. Given these trends in Autonomy 1.0, the prospect of large-scale commercial operations of autonomous vehicles remains distant, likely years away from realization. Autonomy 1.0 is characterized by a modular structure, comprising functional components such as sensing, perception, localization, high-definition maps, prediction, planning, and control [9]. Each of these modules further consists of several functional sub-modules integrated through explicit and hand-crafted logic. Core decision-making tasks, such as planning (responsible for generating optimal and drivable paths), are typically solved using constraint optimization under a large set of manually tuned rules. When a disengagement incident occurs, engineers must undertake a lengthy debugging process to identify which specific module or rule may have triggered the issue. They then optimize that module or develop logic changes to address the specific problem. However, due to the intricate dependencies and coupling among modules and rules, new software versions often lead to unforeseen issues, significantly slowing down the development process. Over time, the Autonomy 1.0 software stack has evolved into a complex collection of ad-hoc rules and interdependent modules designed to handle various long-tail events. This complexity has made the system increasingly difficult to debug, maintain, and improve. The open-source project Apollo serves as a typical example of this complexity. Its perception module alone consists of multiple individual learning-based sub-modules to accomplish tasks such as object detection in 2D images, LiDAR point cloud segmentation, traffic light detection, and lane detection. The planning module makes decisions and plans routes based on data from the perception, prediction, localization, and map modules. These modules often have strong interdependencies, meaning that changes to one module affect the algorithmic performance of downstream modules due to distributional shifts in data, and hence also impact overall system performance. Consequently, the entire system has become complicated and potentially brittle, demanding enormous engineering resources merely to maintain, let alone to advance at a rapid pace. Figure. California: The number of self-driving vehicles, mileage, and disengagements from 2018 to 2022. There are three major scalability bottlenecks of Autonomy 1.0: Complexity Bottleneck: Autonomy 1.0 systems are characterized by intricate designs that demand extensive engineering efforts. These efforts span software and algorithm design, system development, and ongoing maintenance, creating a significant burden on resources and time.\\n\\nHuman-Data Bottleneck: A critical limitation of Autonomy 1.0 systems is their dependence on fleets of physical vehicles operated by humans for data collection and testing purposes. Additionally, these systems require large-scale data labeling for system evaluation and model training. This approach is not only costly but also presents significant challenges in scaling operations effectively.\\n\\nGeneralization Bottleneck: The architecture of Autonomy 1.0 systems heavily relies on rule-based processing logic and handcrafted interfaces. This design philosophy inherently limits the systems’ ability to adapt and generalize to new environments, creating a substantial barrier to widespread deployment and adoption.\\n\\nAutonomy 2.0: Scalability Is Everything While Autonomy 1.0 has been the predominant R&D paradigm for autonomous machines for over a decade, recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have sparked new ideas in system architecture, data and model infrastructure, and engineering practices. These advancements, including Transformers,8 offline reinforcement learning,4 large language models (LLMs),1 neural rendering7 and vision-language-action models,6 have paved the way for a new development paradigm we call Autonomy 2.0. In this section, we will outline the main characteristics of Autonomy 2.0, followed by a discussion of key open questions in the subsequent section. Autonomy 1.0 Autonomy 2.0 Complexity Bottleneck numerous functional modules complicated dependencies among modules complex runtime constraints two main neural network modules clear software interfaces simple resource requirements Human-Data Bottleneck data from road tests and labeling scale with human labor data from synthesis and simulation scale with computing resources Generalization Bottleneck task-specific handcrafted logic complicated software stack task-agnostic learning-based updates simple and stable software stack The cornerstone of Autonomy 2.0 is scalability, which is achieved through two crucial ingredients: A software stack that continuously improves with increasing scale of data and computational resources.\\n\\nA new paradigm based on digital twins for algorithmic exploration using realistic, controllable, and large-scale simulation before deployment. The accompanying table summarizes how Autonomy 2.0 addresses the three bottlenecks present in Autonomy 1.0. Learning-native software stack. Autonomous machines fundamentally perform two main tasks: perception and action, reflecting the natural dichotomy between past and future. The perception task involves observing the environment and inferring its current state based on accumulated observations. The action task, building upon the inferred environmental state, involves selecting an appropriate sequence of actions to achieve specified goals while anticipating various possible near-future environmental changes. Benefits. Autonomy 2.0 addresses the Complexity Bottleneck by significantly reducing the number of learning-based components and, consequently, the amount of non-learning code that requires maintenance. We compare the lines of code in the Apollo Perception module, representing the Autonomy 1.0 approach, with BEVFormer, an example of the perception module in Autonomy 2.0. The Apollo Perception module is 10 times larger than BEVFormer, yet BEVFormer has achieved state-of-the-art perception results. This software architecture also tackles the Generalization Bottleneck present in Autonomy 1.0 by handling corner cases through data-driven model learning instead of handcrafted logic. An analysis of over 400 issues associated with Apollo planning modules reveals that 47% of the issues relate to Apollo failing to handle specific use cases, while 30% are linked to software engineering problems such as interfaces with other modules. In Autonomy 1.0, numerous handcrafted rules are implemented to handle specific use cases. As these rules accumulate, software quality inevitably becomes an issue. Architectural Design. The perception and action modules, while integral parts of autonomous systems, have distinct goals and traditionally require different algorithmic approaches. The perception module is primarily trained using supervised and self-supervised learning techniques. Its objective is to infer a unique ground truth of world states based on sensory inputs. This involves processing and interpreting data from various sensors to create an accurate representation of the environment. In contrast, the action module faces a more complex task. It must search through and choose from many acceptable action sequences while anticipating the diverse potential behaviors of other agents in the environment. This complexity necessitates the use of more diverse methods, including reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and model predictive control. These techniques allow the action module to make decisions that are not only optimal for the current state but also robust to potential future scenarios. Perception. Autonomy 1.0 approaches perception through a set of deep neural networks (DNNs), each trained independently to support specific tasks such as 2D/3D object detection, segmentation, and tracking. In contrast, Autonomy 2.0 employs a more unified approach. Its perception module utilizes a single transformer backbone to provide a cohesive representation of the ego-vehicle’s environment, such as 2D Bird’s Eye View (BEV) or 3D occupancy. This unified representation is then processed by several decoder “heads,” each fine-tuned for a specific task. This single-transformer approach to perception has gained significant traction across the autonomous vehicle industry. Notable examples include Tesla’s description of their system during their “AI Day 2022” event, and the deployment of similar architectures by leading intelligent electric vehicle companies like XPENG. The growing adoption of this approach underscores its potential advantages in streamlining perception tasks and improving overall system efficiency. Action. The action module in autonomous systems faces the complex task of anticipating a combinatorially large number of possible “world trajectories.” It must hypothesize multiple action sequences and evaluate them to select the optimal one for actuator execution. In Autonomy 1.0, this process is broken down into separate sub-modules for prediction, planning, and control. Autonomy 2.0, however, takes a more integrated approach. It implements the action module as an end-to-end learned neural network, leveraging transformer-inspired architectures designed for sequential decision making.2 This unified approach aims to streamline the decision-making process and potentially improve the system’s ability to handle complex, dynamic environments. Simulation-based development and deployment. Autonomy 1.0 heavily relies on human efforts for tasks such as manual data labeling and physical testing, creating a significant scalability bottleneck. In contrast, Autonomy 2.0 address this human-data bottleneck with two key insights: An efficient and sophisticated data “engine” is essential for processing and mining rare and critical driving scenarios from large-scale real-world data. Such data is invaluable for improving system performance.\\n\\nNeural simulators trained with real-world data can be the source of almost unlimited, realistic, scalable and highly controllable driving scenario data for extensive system evaluation and model training, both for environment perception and action planning. Autonomy 2.0 specifically leverages an emerging technology trend known as digital twins, where a virtual representation serves as a realistic and customizable replica of the physical world. In this paradigm, the physical system is meticulously instrumented to collect real-world, real-time data, which is then used to reproduce its digital “clone,” and improve neural simulators continuously. Within this digital realm, driving scenarios can be synthesized with exceptional fidelity, accurately replicating both sensor data and driving behaviors that may be encountered in the real world. This approach offers several key advantages: Realism: The digital twin closely mirrors the complexities and nuances of real-world driving environments.\\n\\nScalability: Virtual scenarios can be generated and modified at a scale far beyond what’s feasible with physical testing.\\n\\nSafety: Dangerous or rare scenarios can be explored without risk to human life or property.\\n\\nEfficiency: The development and testing process can be significantly accelerated, reducing time and costs.\\n\\nIterative Improvement: The constant feedback loop between the physical and digital worlds allows for rapid refinement of the autonomous system. This simulation-centric approach has already been adopted by various autonomous driving companies such as Wayve and Waabi. The development and testing of autonomous driving software using synthesized virtual scenarios offers significant advantages over the physical-only approach of Autonomy 1.0. This method accelerates the evaluation process by a factor of 103 to 1053 and reduces testing costs by two orders of magnitude.10 We have compared the cost efficiency of Autonomy 2.0 versus Autonomy 1.0, and Autonomy 2.0 has achieved a dramatic 90-fold reduction in costs, and 1,000-fold improvement in R&D efficiency measured as kmiles/vehicle/year. The combined effect of these improvements results in a potential 105-fold enhancement in overall efficiency under the same engineering investment in Autonomy 2.0. This paradigm shift effectively eliminates the human-data bottleneck, as scalability becomes primarily constrained by available computational resources rather than the number of engineers.  \n",

                           Despite evidence supporting the relationship between online risk exposure and anxiety, the underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. This study aimed to construct and validate a chain-mediation structural equation model to investigate how online risk exposure influences anxiety among college students. Data was collected online in April 2023 from a sample of college students (N = 986, 64.6% female) using validated scales measuring online risk exposure, negative attribution, interpersonal security, and anxiety. The results showed that online risk exposure not only directly exacerbates anxiety but also indirectly affects it through three distinct pathways: negative attribution, interpersonal insecurity, and their chain relationship. These mediation effects accounted for 41.16%, 20.47%, and 4.65% of the total effects, respectively. These findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions aimed at reducing online risk exposure, improving negative attribution styles, and enhancing interpersonal security among college students. The study concludes by discussing its limitations and proposing directions for future research.\\n\\nFunding: This research was supported by the \"Fourteenth Five-Year Plan” Planning Project of Education Science in Shaanxi Province (Grant No. SGH23Y2281), 2024 Annual Project of Shaanxi Province Foundation of Social Science (Grant No. 2024P006), Key Project of National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 23&ZD238), the Key Project of Education and Teaching Reform of Higher Education of Shaanxi Province of China (Grant No. 23ZZ020), the Project of Education and Teaching Reform of Post-graduate Education of Shaanxi Normal University ((Grant No. GERP-24-27), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. GK24ZYZD001).\\n\\nCopyright: © 2025 Wang et al.

This extension aims to address the questions of “how online risk exposure affects anxiety among college students” and “how to reduce anxiety caused by online risk exposure”. These insights are vital in aiding mental health professionals to develop more precise and impactful intervention tactics to mitigate the damage from online risk exposure.\\n\\nMoreover, online risk exposure refers to the extent to which an individual directly experiences or encounters various negative risk situations while using the internet, which mainly includes four risk scenarios: information disclosure, cyberbullying, online sexual solicitation, and exposure to violent or explicit content [ 6 , 7 ], the prevalence rates within specific subgroups of college students are in order: 75.6% [ 8 ], 11.3% to 32.1% [ 9 , 10 ], 15.3% to 48.4% [ 11 ], and 28.6% to 90% [ 8 , 12 ]. Several studies have indicated that online risk activities significantly impact individuals’ emotional well-being [ 13 – 16 ], and may even precipitate self-harm and suicidal behaviors [ 10 , 17 ]. This underscores the high detection rate and severity of online risk exposure within the university student population, revealing that online risk exposure has emerged as a significant social issue and a novel threat to college students’ emotional health [ 5 ]. To our knowledge, however, no studies have examined in depth the mechanisms through which online risk exposure affects the anxiety of college students.\\n\\nAnxiety, which is a negative emotion experienced when individuals perceive potential negative consequences in risky situations [ 1 ], is notably characterized by an acute sense of apprehension, prevalent feelings of unease and concern, as well as maladaptive behaviors [ 2 ]. Indeed, moderate levels of anxiety can serve a crucial role by eliciting heightened alertness, augmenting concentration, and optimizing academic efficiency among college students, nevertheless, persistent and excessive anxiety can have a serious impact on daily life [ 3 ]. The prevalence of anxiety among college students has been on the rise, with rates reaching 13.7% over the past decade [ 4 ]. The etiology of anxiety is intricate and diverse, particularly in the era of “Internet+” and AI, where the effects of cyber information security and online risk activities on college students’ anxiety are becoming more prominent, with one study showing a significant correlation between online risk exposure and anxiety among college students [ 5 ]. To enhance the prevention and intervention of anxiety among college students, it is imperative for educators and students alike to focus on its genesis. Consequently, there is a critical need to delve into the inherent mechanisms mediating the relationship between online risk exposure and anxiety in college students.\\n\\n2. Literature review and hypotheses establishment\\n\\n2.1. The fundament theoretical framework Lazarus, an American psychologist, introduced the cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion in 1991, positing a close interconnection and interaction between cognition, motivation, and emotion. Emotion is an individual’s response to meaning, i.e., how the individual makes sense of the stimulus event [18,19]. If a person views a stimulus event as having a positive or negative effect on him or her, a corresponding emotional or reactive inclination will emerge. Lazarus conducted a thorough examination of “cognitive appraisal” and “coping”, positing that whether an individual felt stressed when coping with emergencies hinged on these two principal psychological processes [20,21]. “Cognitive appraisal” refers to how people assess a situation’s effect on them, while “coping” involves managing the conflict between a person and the situation through actions or cognitive techniques, as well as this coping can bridge the gap between the risk events and the emotional outcomes. Emotional states change from the beginning to the end of the coping process. Concurrently, motivation plays an important role in the process of coping, and it can lead to either positive or negative emotional feedback effects. “Negative coping” can easily induce adverse emotional experiences and bring harm to individuals, while “positive coping” can help to resolve internal conflicts and benefit individuals, thus producing positive emotional experiences. Consequently, Lazarus’ cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion highlights the crucial role of cognitive appraisal and coping strategies in shaping individuals’ emotional reactions, pointing out that how an individual comprehends and responds to a stimulus event determines their positive or negative emotional experiences.\\n\\n2.2. Online risk exposure and anxiety Extensive researches had demonstrated the negative implications of online risks, such as cyberbullying and sexual solicitation, on individuals’ emotional well-being [14,16,17,22]. The latest research had established a positive correlation between online risk exposure and anxiety [5]. Lifestyle exposure theory (LET) posits that individuals’ likelihood of victimization increases with their extent of exposure to potential criminals and risky situations [23,24]. The variation in online lifestyles, behaviors, and interactions with unfamiliar social contacts can result in different levels of potential harm, explaining why some individuals may become victims of network crimes. For example, research has shown a correlation between online risk activities associated with lifestyle, leisure, and social networking, and the occurrence of online bullying among adolescents [25]. Besides, 45.8% of Chinese college students spend an average of three to six hours daily on their smartphones, mainly for recreational activities [26]. Considering that a significant proportion of Chinese college students spend several hours daily engaging in recreational activities on smartphones, it is evident that increased online activity can lead to greater exposure to potential risks. From the perspective of the LET, online risk exposure can be viewed as an environment that heightens the propensity for criminal activities, thereby increasing college students’ anxiety and vulnerability to victimization. In conclusion, we propose the first research hypothesis (H1): online risk exposure is positively correlated with anxiety levels among college students.\\n\\n2.3. The role of negative attribution in online risk exposure and anxiety Negative attribution refers to individuals’ tendency to interpret others’ attitudes, behaviors, or events negatively, even when these may not explicitly involve negativity [27]. Cognitive-emotional process model [28] suggest that attributing causality to specific entities or occurrences is crucial in shaping individuals’ emotional responses. Attribution, a cognitive procedure involving causal explanations for favorable and unfavorable outcomes [29], plays a pivotal role in this process. Individuals with positive attributions lean towards external, unstable, and specific explanations during adverse circumstances, while those with negative attributions tend to ascribe internal, stable, and universal interpretations [30]. According to stress-coping theory, cognitive appraisals serve as a bridge between stressful events and subsequent reactions [20,21]. Previous research has demonstrated that stress can lead individuals to adopt maladaptive attribution styles. For example, children exposed to adverse situations, such as victimization, frequently attribute these experiences to their own negative traits, with the severity of negative attributions positively correlated with the frequency of victimization. [31]. Attribution styles are closely linked to psychological well-being [32], with negative attribution leading to feelings of despair and a perceived lack of control over life events [33], which is a significant risk factor for anxiety. Additionally, there is a direct correlation between the negativity of attribution style and the intensity of anxiety [34]. Furthermore, negative attribution may function as a mediator in the association between online risk exposure and anxiety. According to the cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, individuals evaluate the perceived threat, challenge, or harm of an event, which elicits varied emotional responses and subsequently shapes their behavioral outcomes [18,19]. Cognitive appraisal acts as a mediating mechanism in the relationship between risk incidents and emotional outcomes, influencing an individual’s emotional state from the initial encounter to its resolution [20,21]. At the same time, empirical studies showed that risk exposure, especially sexual abuse, was directly, positively associated with negative attributions [35]. Consistent with this perspective, negative attribution, functioning as a cognitive appraisal process [29], may play a mediating role in the relationship between online risk exposure and anxiety. Drawing from the above relevant studies, it can be inferred that negative attribution acts as a conduit between online risk exposure (the stimulus event) and anxiety (the ensuing response). Thus, we propose our second research hypothesis (H2): Negative attribution mediates the relationship between online risk exposure and anxiety.\\n\\n2.4. The role of interpersonal security in online risk exposure and anxiety Interpersonal security refers to the positive experience individuals derive from maintaining a favorable self-perception during interpersonal interactions [26]. It encompasses feelings of interpersonal harmony, optimism and cheerfulness, respect and friendship, as well as happiness and warmth in relationships [25]. More importantly, interpersonal security is not only a fundamental aspect of overall security [24, 25], but also plays a crucial role in the formation of interpersonal relationships [39]. Individuals who possess a sense of interpersonal security feel at ease, confident, and fulfilled in their interactions with others, enabling them to cultivate lasting relationships without succumbing to excessive unease or anxiety during environmental shifts; Conversely, individuals lacking interpersonal security are more prone to questioning the benevolence of others [40], which can lead to lower self-esteem, emotional distress [41,42], and a greater inclination towards adverse behaviors [43]. Notably, low interpersonal security has been linked to suicidal ideation [44]. Taken together, interpersonal security is a positive and important experience derived from self-perception rooted in a sense of acceptance and belonging during social interaction, while its absence can lead to maladaptive outcomes, such as emotional distress (e.g., anxiety), and problem behaviors (e.g., social avoidance) [45]. Furthermore, interpersonal security may also play an important role between online risk exposure and anxiety. On the one hand, online risk exposure, as a negative and complex social interaction situation, can contribute to interpersonal suspicion and insecurity. There is some evidence that individuals frequently grappled with profound insecurity when confronted by risks or losses [28]. Specifically, breaches of private information seriously undermine interpersonal security and victims develop distrust of others as a result of the invasion of their privacy, and this distrust leads to anxiety and unease in individuals, making it difficult for them to establish stable interpersonal relationships [13,46]. Cyberbullying has a profoundly destructive effect on the interpersonal security, not only leading to isolation, social segregation and damage to the victim’s self-esteem, but also potentially triggering anxiety, depression and even suicidal tendencies [45]. Its persistence and anonymity make it difficult for victims to escape, thus deepening their fear and insecurity of interpersonal interactions [13]. Online sexual solicitation profoundly affects interpersonal security by violating physical and psychological boundaries, causing excessive suspicion and distrust, and leading to social avoidance due to feelings of shame and fear [47,48]. On the other hand, interpersonal security is an important variable influencing anxiety [49]. Empirical studies have also shown a negative correlation between interpersonal security and anxiety among college students [40,41]. Thus, it was further hypothesized that interpersonal security would mediate the relationship between online risk exposure and anxiety (H3).  \n",
