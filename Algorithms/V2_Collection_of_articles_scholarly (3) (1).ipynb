      "Full Abstract: The application of functional materials and devices (FM&Ds) underpins numerous products and services, facilitating improved quality of life, but also constitutes a huge environmental burden on the natural ecosystem, prompting the need to quantify their value-chain impact using the bottom-up life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. As the volume of FM&Ds manufactured increases, the LCA calculation speed is constrained due to the time-consuming nature of data collection and processing. Moreover, the bottom-up LCA framework is limited in scope, being typically static or retrospective, and laced with data gap challenges, resulting in the use of proxy values, thus limiting the relevance, accuracy, and quality of results. In this prospective article, we explore how these challenges across all phases of the bottom-up LCA framework can be overcome by harnessing new insights garnered from computationally guided parameterized models enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as machine learning (ML), applicable to all products in general and specifically to FM&Ds, for which adoption remains underexplored.\n",

      "Full Abstract: Nowadays, product designers, manufacturers, and consumers consider the environmental impacts of products, processes, and services in their decision-making process. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool that assesses the environmental impacts over a product’s life cycle. Conducting a life cycle assessment (LCA) requires meticulous data sourcing and collection and is often time-consuming for both practitioner and verifier. However, predicting the environmental impacts of products and services can help stakeholders and decision-makers identify the hotspots. Our work proposes using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to predict the environmental performance of a product or service to assist LCA practitioners and verifiers. This approach uses data from environmental product declarations of construction products. The data is processed utilizing natural language processing (NLP) which is then trained to random forest algorithm, an ensemble tree-based machine learning method. Finally, we trained the model with information on the product and their environmental impacts using seven impact category values and verified the results using a testing dataset (20% of EPD data). Our results demonstrate that the model was able to predict the values of impact categories: global warming potential, abiotic depletion potential for fossil resources, acidification potential, and photochemical ozone creation potential with an accuracy (measured using R2 metrics, a measure to score the correlation of predicted values to real value) of 81%, 77%, 68%, and 70%, respectively. Our method demonstrates the capability to predict environmental performance with a defined variability by learning from the results of the previous LCA studies. The model’s performance also depends on the amount of data available for training. However, this approach does not replace a detailed LCA but is rather a quick prediction and assistance to LCA practitioners and verifiers in realizing an LCA.\n",

      "Full Abstract: Applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to optimize waste management strategies, focusing on enhancing economic efficiency and reducing environmental impact, is vital. The study utilized ML models to analyze and forecast waste generation trends, assess the viability of various waste management methods, and develop optimization models for resource allocation and operational efficiency. The research employs the World Bank’s comprehensive waste management dataset. After rigorous data preprocessing, including cleaning and feature selection, a variety of ML techniques, such as regression models, classification algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and optimization algorithms, including linear programming, are applied. Unlike other research, this study achieved 85 % accuracy on predictive analytics models for forecasting waste generation trends, primarily attributed to integrating more diverse data sets, including socio-economic factors. Also, the optimization resource allocation achieved a 15 % increase in operational efficiency. These findings provide significant insights for policymakers and urban planners, suggesting that integrating ML in waste management can lead to more sustainable and cost-effective practices. This paper demonstrates the transformative potential of ML in optimizing waste management strategies, offering a pathway towards more sustainable and economically viable waste management solutions globally.\n",

      "Full Abstract: The artificial intelligence (AI) fast growth and its broad impact on various sectors need an evaluation of its effect on the accomplishment of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). AI is the biggest influence on the global economy. AI plays a very important role in achieving environmental sustainability—from ending hunger and poverty to achieving sustainable energy and gender equality for the protection and preservation of biodiversity. The SDGs are divided into three categories namely society, economy, and environment. This division allows us to come up with an overview of the general impact areas of AI. AI finds application in a wide array of environmental sectors, which include natural resource conservation, energy management, wildlife protection, pollution control and agriculture, clean energy, and waste management. AI will support energy systems having low carbon footprint with more energy efficiency, which are required to address climate change. AI can help in managing the complex ecosystem structure and functions effectively. Apart from above-mentioned applications it can also help in identifying desertification trends over large areas, in decision-making and environmental planning. Due to advent of many new technologies, AI can be now implemented in those countries which are having different cultural values and wealth. This has popularized the method all over the world. Advanced AI-based product design, technology, and research may require vast computational resources which can be made available through enormous computing centers. Such facilities require huge energy requirement and have massive carbon footprint. AI-based ecosystem information may cause exploitation of resources, although this kind of misuse has not been reported adequately. The AI development needs to be supported and guarded by the requisite regulatory body. The oversight will result in gaps in safety, transparency, and ethical standards. Today's need is to develop AI which is more eco-friendly not only today but for generations to come.\n",

      "Full Abstract: Climate change has become the most important issue that face the humanity and hazed the life on the earth. Therefore, the researches have been conducted in continuous mode to reduce the native impacts of climate change and to control its sources. The environmental damage due to the climate change may include, pollution transfer through food chain which affect the food sustainability. In addition, the climate change leads to loss or migration of some species of living organisms including plants, animals, and human resulting in biodiversity change and/or security disturbance. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) enhances the human ability to control climate change for achieving sustainability during usage of environmental resources. This chapter concludes the benefit of AI for addressing environmental problems and preserving the eco-system for sustainable urban development.\n",

      "Full Abstract: Analyzing satellite images and remote sensing (RS) data using artificial intelligence (AI) tools and data fusion strategies has recently opened new perspectives for environmental monitoring and assessment. This is mainly due to the advancement of machine learning (ML) and data mining approaches, which facilitate extracting meaningful information at a large scale from geo-referenced and heterogeneous sources. This paper presents the first review of AI-based methodologies and data fusion strategies used for environmental monitoring, to the best of the authors’ knowledge. The first part of the article discusses the main challenges of geographical image analysis. Thereafter, a well-designed taxonomy is introduced to overview the existing frameworks, which have been focused on: (i) detecting different environmental impacts, e.g. land cover land use (LULC) change, gully erosion susceptibility (GES), waterlogging susceptibility (WLS), and land salinity and infertility (LSI); (ii) analyzing AI models deployed for extracting the pertinent features from RS images in addition to data fusion techniques used for combining images and/or features from heterogeneous sources; (iii) describing existing publicly-shared and open-access datasets; (iv) highlighting most frequent evaluation metrics; and (v) describing the most significant applications of ML and data fusion for RS image analysis. This is followed by an overview of existing works and discussions highlighting some of the challenges, limitations and shortcomings. To provide the reader with insight into real-world applications, two case studies illustrate the use of AI for classifying LULC changes and monitoring the environmental impacts due to dams’ construction, where classification accuracies of 98.57% and 97.05% have been reached, respectively. Lastly, recommendations and future directions are drawn.\n",

      "Full Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to create more sustainable production methods and model climate change, making it a valuable tool in the fight against environmental degradation. This paper describes the paradox of an energy-consuming technology serving the ecological challenges of tomorrow. The study provides an overview of the sectors that use AI-based solutions for environmental protection. It draws on numerous examples from AI for Green players to present use cases and concrete examples. In the second part of the study, the negative impacts of AI on the environment and the emerging technological solutions to support Green AI are examined. It is also shown that the research on less energy-consuming AI is motivated more by cost and energy autonomy constraints than by environmental considerations. This leads to a rebound effect that favors an increase in the complexity of models. Finally, the need to integrate environmental indicators into algorithms is discussed. The environmental dimension is part of the broader ethical problem of AI, and addressing it is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of AI in the long term.\n",
