# Environmental Impacts of AI: The Lifecycle of AI-based Services

This repository contains the Beamer presentation and supporting files for the ARCEP project titled **"Environmental Impacts of AI: The Lifecycle of AI-based Services"**, developed as part of the **Data & Economics for Public Policy Master** at **École Polytechnique and ENSAE**.
  

## Context
This project was carried out in collaboration with **ARCEP** (French Regulatory Authority for Electronic Communications, Postal and Print Media Distribution), exploring the **environmental footprint of AI systems across their full lifecycle** using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach.

## Presentation Overview
The presentation is structured into the following key sections:

1. **The Project** – Framing the central research question.
2. **Our Objectives** – Literature review, automated monitoring of research and news.
3. **Methods** – Use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to analyze AI impacts.
4. **Literature Review Plan** – Covering:
   - Direct environmental impacts (production, transport, operation, end-of-life)
   - Indirect impacts (rebound effects)
   - Positive contributions of AI (energy efficiency, sustainability)
   - Mitigation strategies (regulation, transparency, behavior)
5. **Tool Development** – Python algorithms for scraping:
   - Scientific articles from Google Scholar
   - News articles via News API

## Files Included
- `ARCEP_Presentation.pdf` – Final version of the presentation slides.
- `README.md` – This file.

## Tools & Technologies presented
