# Environmental Impact of AI – ARCEP Report (March 2025)

This repository contains the full literature review report titled **“Environmental Impact of AI”**, developed in collaboration with **ARCEP** as part of the **Policy-in-Action project** in the Master’s in Data & Economics for Public Policy at **École Polytechnique, ENSAE, Telecom**.

##  Partner Institution
- **ARCEP** – Autorité de régulation des communications électroniques, des postes et de la distribution de la presse (France)

## Project Summary

This literature review explores the **environmental footprint of AI systems** using the **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** methodology. It captures both **direct** and **indirect impacts**—from material extraction and manufacturing to operational emissions, rebound effects, and disposal.

The report also proposes strategic levers for building **frugal AI**, combining legal, technical, and behavioral approaches.

## Report Structure

1. **Introduction**  
   - LCA methodology  
   - Scope of AI lifecycle analysis  

2. **Direct Negative Environmental Impacts of AI**  
   - Hardware Production: carbon emissions, rare earth mining, and water use  
   - Transportation: GHG emissions from global supply chains  
   - Operation: energy use, water consumption, and hardware variability  
   - End-of-Life: e-waste, recycling challenges, emissions from retirement

3. **Indirect Negative Environmental Impacts of AI**  
   - Material rebound effects  
   - Economic rebound effects (Jevons Paradox)  
   - Societal rebound effects (induction and time rebound)

4. **Positive Environmental Contributions of AI**  
   - Energy efficiency  
   - Renewable energy integration  
   - Precision agriculture  
   - Smart waste management  
   - Environmental monitoring and biodiversity conservation

5. **Future Considerations and Mitigation Strategies**  
   - Regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, CNIL, France 2030)  
   - Transparency mechanisms (GHG disclosures, standardized KPIs)  
   - Behavioral insights and nudging tools (e.g., Carbontracker, Eco2AI)  
   - Emerging sustainable trends (frugal algorithms, efficient data centers)

6. **Conclusion & Policy Implications**  
   - Aligning AI innovation with planetary boundaries  
   - Designing lifecycle-conscious governance frameworks
